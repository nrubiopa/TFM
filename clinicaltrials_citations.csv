The impact of BCI test results on extended endocrine therapy decision-making and clinical use patterns will be characterized. Extended endocrine therapy-specific medication adherence will be assessed annually. Primary tumor tissue will be collected for scientific research purposes including molecular profiling and for correlative studies. The sample size will consist of approximately 3,000 subjects across 30-50 sites in the United States.

The BCI registry will recruit patients with HR+ stage I to III breast cancer following an initial 4-7 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy that will have BCI testing performed as part of routine clinical care and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After signing the informed consent form (ICF) during screening, physicians and patients will complete the pre-test Decision Impact Questionnaire. Upon ordering BCI by the treating physician, primary tumor tissue obtained from the patient during previous breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy will be requested by Biotheranostics to perform BCI testing at Biotheranostics' CLIA certified and CAP accredited clinical laboratory in San Diego, CA. Following BCI testing, the physician will share and discuss the BCI results with their patients and recommend to either stop or extend endocrine therapy for an additional 5 years. The impact of the BCI test results on extended endocrine therapy decision-making will be assessed using the post-test Decision Impact Questionnaire, which will be completed by both physicians and patients. In addition, medication adherence will be evaluated in patients that are recommended for or elect to continue treatment to complete 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy.

BCI reports both a prognostic and predictive result and has been shown to significantly stratify patients based on the risk of late distant recurrence as well as to predict the likelihood of benefit from endocrine therapy in multiple prospective-retrospective studies within randomized controlled trial cohorts. The BCI registry study will determine the long-term outcome and BCI test performance to add prospective validation for the prognostic and predictive capabilities of BCI. In this context, the impact of BCI test results on treatment decision-making and subsequently prescribed treatments will be characterized.

Analysis of BCI test performance with long-term outcome will be performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test to assess the statistical significance of the risk stratification by BCI risk groups. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to derive the hazard ratios (HR) and the associated 95% confidence intervals for the comparison of BCI risk groups. Univariate and multivariate analysis adjusting for clinical factors such as age, tumor size, grade, and treatment background (adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemotherapy) will be conducted. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate the decision-impact and medication adherence scores of patients enrolled in the study.

Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this trial, in compliance with Section 4.9 of the ICH E6 GCP, and regulatory and institutional requirements for the protection of confidentiality of subjects. As part of participating in a Biotheranostics-sponsored study, each site will permit authorized representatives of the sponsor and regulatory agencies to examine clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of the study progress. The clinical trial manager will be in regular contact with the site research leader to check on progress and address any queries that they may have. Sites may be suspended from participating in the registry in the event of serious and persistent non-compliance with the protocol and/or Good Clinical Practice. Any major problems identified will be reported to the Trial Management Team and if necessary, the relevant regulatory bodies.","Inclusion Criteria:

While there are guidelines encouraging PCPs to assess patients' breast cancer risk, few PCPs assess patients' risk due to time constraints in primary care, lack of familiarity with risk calculators, and knowledge on how to incorporate risk into the care of women. Around 20% of PCPs have reported using a risk calculator but few routinely asses patients' risk. In HealthCare Associates (HCA), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's primary-care based practice, the online medical record (OMR) has recently been edited to allow for PCPs to enter patients' breast cancer risk. However, it is not known whether PCPs are using this tab. To calculate patient's breast cancer risk, PCPs must go to web-based calculators, ask patients their risk factors, enter the information and then add the estimated risk to OMR. Previous studies suggest that leaving risk assessment to PCPs results in few women having their risk assessed. Instead, PCPs tend to simply use family history when deciding whether or not patients are at high risk. However, family history is only one risk factor for breast cancer. Therefore, the investigators will send women ages 40-49 participating in this study a questionnaire to complete before a visit to assess their risk factors for breast cancer. Using this information, the investigators will calculate patients' breast cancer risk using the available breast cancer risk assessment models and will present women with a personalized breast cancer risk report immediately before a visit with their PCP. After the visit, patients will be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire about their experience and through their medical records will be followed to learn whether or not they are screened with mammography.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the spread of cancer cells to distant organs, therefore, is a prerequisite for the development of novel cancer therapies.",Role of Sorcin and Annexin A3 in Breast Cancer Patients,"September 30, 2019",Anticipated,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,"Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy worldwide. Despite advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment in recent years, traditional treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy) are always limited by the resistance of some tumor cells, thus forcing researchers to continue to look for new therapeutic approaches and targets. Soluble resistance-related Calcium-binding protein (Sorcin) is a penta-EF hand calcium binding protein, which participates in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in cells and has molecular mass of 22 kDa. The EF-hand is a common helix-loop-helix structural motif used by proteins to bind calcium. Most proteins are endowed with an even number of EF-hands, which are usually structurally and functionally paired. The penta-EF hand (PEF) family includes sorcin, calpains, programmed cell death protein 6 (PDCD6), peflin and grancalcin.

High sorcin regulates the calcium channels and exchangers located at the plasma membrane and at the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) and allows high levels of calcium in the ER to be maintained, preventing ER stress and the unfolded protein response, and increases escape from apoptosis. The 18-kDa variant of sorcin is regulated by Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein upregulated in several human tumors which controls sorcin folding and expression. Conversely, sorcin silencing activates apoptotic proteases as caspase-3 and caspase-12 results in major defects in mitosis and cytokinesis, blocks cell cycle progression in mitosis, increases the number of rounded polynucleated cells and induces apoptosis and cell death shifting the equilibrium between cell life and cell death towards proliferation in MDR cancer cells overexpressing sorcin.

Sorcin is highly expressed in the heart, brain and breast and overexpressed in many cancer cells. The gene for sorcin (SRI) spans about 21.9 kb of human genomic DNA. The gene is located in chromosome 7q21. Sorcin gene is in the same amplicon as other genes involved in the resistance to chemotherapeutics in cancer cells (multi-drug resistance, MDR) such as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCB4 and ABCB1 (Mdr1, or P-glycoprotein 1).

Annexins are a family of intracellular proteins that bind membrane phospholipids in a Calcium concentration-dependent manner. The human genome encodes for 12 different annexins varying in expression and distribution within the tissues. Some of these are ubiquitously expressed (A1, A2, A5, A6, and A7), while some are selective (A3, A8, A9, A10, and A13). Several annexins play important roles during tumor progression. However, little is known about the clinical implications and biological functions of Annexin A3 (ANXA3) in breast cancer. ANXA3 has a role in cell differentiation, cell migration, immune regulation.

The ANXA3 gene is located on human chromosome 4q13-q22 and encodes a protein of 323 amino acid residues. Annexin A3 participates in various tumor-associated biological processes, including tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and is associated with chemotherapy resistance.

ANXA3 is expressed and secreted by neoplastic mammary cells, and its inhibition halts migration in breast cancer cells. The expression of Annexin A3 in human breast carcinoma closely correlated with tumor size and axillary lymph node metastasis. Elevated serum levels of ANXA3 protein were due to its increased secretion from neoplastic breast cells into the systemic circulation. There is inverse correlation between Annexin A3 expression and overall breast cancer patient survival. Moreover, Annexin A3 might be a novel and potential prognostic marker for patients with breast cancer and is involved in regulating apoptosis by affecting the Bcl-2/Bax balance. It promote the transcription of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and downregulate the proapoptotic gene BAX.","Inclusion Criteria:

Results of the UK study will be combined with those from additional sites, including those in Canada, with additional samples expected from the United States and South Korea. Syantra DX Breast Cancer measures gene expression signatures in whole blood, and has been retrospectively demonstrated in 780 samples. The test uses proprietary algorithms to analyse gene expression characteristics from a novel multi-biomarker panel, and then classify a sample as positive or negative for breast cancer. Based upon test performance in a retrospective environment, a prospective validation study is being proposed, and is described below.

The study seeks to evaluate performance of Syantra DX Breast Cancer in prospective samples and to optimize test methodology and biomarkers. Key to performance of the study is recruitment of women who have received an abnormal mammography report, and have been classified under the UK Royal College of Radiologists Breast Group (RCRBG) scoring system in categories 3 - 5. This will support the ability to employ the test for breast cancer detection in a screening/call-back environment. To complete the study cohort, additional women will be recruited from the population who have normal or benign mammography results (RCRBG category 1 and 2), and/or a recent normal physical breast exam, with no history of breast cancer. Blood samples will be acquired from all women following completion of an informed consent procedure.

For those with an abnormal mammogram, blood will be drawn before a biopsy is performed. All sample information will be de-identified, and the samples will be processed and analysed according to Syantra DX Breast Cancer standard operating procedures. These procedures include extracting sample RNA and aliquoting for storage in a manner that maintains sample anonymity. All processing and analysis will be conducted in a blind environment without knowing the associated RCRBG or pathology outcomes for any samples. Only after testing is complete will sample classifications be revealed. Syantra DX Breast Cancer results will then be compared to RCRBG, biopsy and pathology data to determine concordance, and statistics will be calculated. If or when biomarker panel or test methodology is modified during the performance of the study, samples will be reanalysed with updated test parameters. This reanalysis will make use of a de-identified aliquot of sample RNA to ensure that testing is maintained in a blind environment.

There is an optional part of the study procedure that is included as 'additional research'. A specific question seeking approval for the additional research is included on the study consent form. For individuals who agree to participate in the additional research, material extracted from their blood sample will be stored for additional investigations.","Inclusion criteria

The Breast Cancer Locator is a plastic bra-like form that gives the surgeon information about the location of the cancer in the breast.

The BCL is then custom-made for the patient using 3D printing technology.

The surgeon can feel the cancer, and the surgeon will remove the cancer by feeling the edges of it as the surgeon would normally. Since the cancer can be felt, the surgeon does not need an image guidance system such as the BCL to locate the cancer in the breast. Other women may have breast cancers that cannot be felt, but are only identified by mammography or MRI. If the BCL proves to accurately localize breast cancer, it may be a useful guide for the surgeon for these other women.

We will use the sample (slides) recovered from the surgery on primary tumor (breast cancer responsible for metastatic disease).,Other: Breast cancer metastatic to bone,Breast cancer metastatic to bone,,"Bone metastases represent a frequent complication of some solid tumours, particularly prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. Bone metastases can cause pain and give rise to the so-called ""Skeletal-related Events"" (SRE) such as pathological fractures and nerve compression. Despite advances in cancer treatment in general, treatment options for bone metastases remain inadequate and generally palliative. It is therefore necessary to identify patients at ""high risk"" of developing metastases at an early stage of neoplastic disease in order to counteract it. Therefore, the identification of changes in the expression of proteins that could be variously involved in the progression of breast cancer is of primary importance since they could act as prognostic factors and therefore address the therapeutic strategy. The aim of the investigators is to clarify the role of de-regulation of post-translational events (such as SUMOylation) in the progression of breast cancer.",Evaluation of Prognostic Factors: From Breast Cancer to Bone Metastases,"November 12, 2024",Anticipated,Breast Cancer Metastatic,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,"The most serious aspect of neoplastic disease is the spread of cancer cells to secondary sites, often distant from the primary site of growth. Bone is a breeding ground for many types of cancer, especially those derived from breast, prostate and lung. Despite the enormous progress in diagnosis and therapeutic strategies, bone metastases still have a profound impact on quality of life and survival, being often responsible for the outcome of the disease. To improve the outcome of patients with poor prognosis, a deep knowledge of the mechanisms underlying dissemination, colonization and progression of cancer cells in the bone is necessary.

The investigators therefore intend to clarify some pathogenic mechanisms involved in the growth of bone metastases, and to uncover predictive signs that underlie the spread of breast cancer cells to bone.

Primary aim of the investigators is to deepen the role of the de-regulation of post-translational events, such as Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier- (SUMO) SUMO-ylation in the progression of breast cancer. The expression of SENP1 (a member of the SUMO-specific protease family) in bone metastatic and non-metastatic mammary carcinomas will be evaluated. The evaluation of the expression of SENP1 in bone metastases will be finalised to define a possible use as a therapeutic target. SENP1 could be a potential prognostic indicator of the neoplastic progression of breast cancer and a potential therapeutic target, but data on its participation in the process of metastasis to bone are still scarce. Moreover, the investigators try to deepen the knowledge of the interaction between tumour cells and bone microenvironment and the role of immunosurveillance as an important part of the immune response against to neoplastic cells. Finally, the investigators will analyze the role of autophagy and apoptosis in the dissemination and growth of metastases due to the capacity of autophagy to provide energy, nutrients and resistance to anoikis, and to promote the dissemination of cancer cells and metastatic growth.","Inclusion Criteria:

Here breast cancer risk is calculated using popular risk prediction models like the Tyrer-Cuzick, CanRisk or Gail models. These models combine breast cancer risk factors to calculate a risk estimate for women. Risk factors include, family history, hormonal and reproductive factors, and risk factors related to health behaviours, for example, smoking, exercise and alcohol intake.

Recently, risk estimation for breast cancer has become more accurate with the inclusion of mammographic density and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) into popular risk prediction models. The addition of these new risk factors could alter the risk estimates that women in FHRPCs have been provided. How much these new risk factors alter a previously given risk estimate is unknown. It is also unknown how women will react to a revised risk estimate, especially if it changes their previous estimate and their access to preventive management options.

This research aims to explore this gap in the literature.",FH-Risk 2.0: Updating Breast Cancer Risk Estimates,"October 31, 2024",Anticipated,Breast Cancer Risk,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,"Estimation of breast cancer risk is important since it enables selection of a high and moderate risk population who benefit from more frequent breast screening and the introduction of targeted measures to reduce risk such as lifestyle change, chemoprevention and risk reducing surgery. Traditionally, risk is estimated by combining information concerning family history and non-familial factors, such as age of menarche and first pregnancy. Subsequent management is related to the degree of risk (high, moderate or average) according to NICE guidelines. Members of the research team and others have added mammographic density (MD) and breast cancer risk associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to risk models which improves the accuracy of risk estimation but which may change the original given risk and risk management given before the updated models became available.

The objective of this body of work is to quantify change in risk and risk management when MD and SNPs are incorporated into two standard models (Tyrer-Cuzick v8 & BOADACEA V). A second objective of the study is to determine the psychological effects of change of risk and management.

This work will use participant data from the Family History Risk (FH-Risk) study to recalculate risk. The FH-Risk study population consists of 954 women referred to the Family History Risk and Prevention Clinic (FHRPC) between 2000 and 2012 who gave informed consent for DNA testing and estimation of MD as part of the FH-Risk study which recruited between 2010 and 2012. Change in risk and management will be calculated by comparing given risk at the time of clinic entry compared with re-estimated risk when MD and SNPs are added to the risk models according to NICE guidelines. Risk will be estimated retrospectively at the time of entry to the clinic and the time of latest follow up.

A sample of those who took part in the FH-Risk study who are still in the FHRPC for follow-up or discharged (approx.954) will be given the opportunity to discuss their updated risk.

Following the risk update consultation a sample of women will be asked whether they would like to take part in an interview to assess the psychological effects of the change, as well as their views and perceptions of the change. These interviews will inform the development of information materials for communicating recalculated risk. These materials will be appraised via 'think aloud' interviews with women from the FH-Risk study who have received their recalculated risk.

The results of this work are likely to inform the next iteration of NICE management guidelines for Family History Clinics, as well as inform the creation of patient facing information materials to aid patient - healthcare professional communication. The findings will also be used to develop a questionnaire to be given to women who previously took part in the FH-Risk study to assess the psychological impact of changed risk in a definitive study.

This body of work is split into 3 studies:

Study 1 - risk recalculation

Risk recalculation will be performed for all women who took part in the original FH-Risk study, with all women (still under follow up at the FHRPC or discharged) given the opportunity to attend a consultation to discuss their revised breast cancer risk estimate.

Study 2 - women's experiences of receiving a revised breast cancer risk estimate.

One to one semi-structured interviews will be conducting with women from study 1 to explore their experiences of receiving a revised breast cancer risk estimate. Breast cancer risk appraisals, the trustworthiness of the estimate, women's emotional responses will all be considered in these interviews. Information and communication needs will also be explored.

Study 3 - women's appraisals of information materials for women who have received a revised breast cancer risk estimate

Women in this study will read a suite of information materials which have been designed to explain why they have received a revised breast cancer risk estimate.

For women aged 40-49, effectiveness is less and less certain. For those over 70, the most important concern is overdiagnosis. In Europe, so far, both age groups have been invited to screen only in a few countries and regional areas, including some Italian regions. Recently, new European guidelines have been published, developed in the framework of the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer. Although with caution, they recommend screening for both women aged 45-49 and those aged 70-74. The recommended interval is 2 or 3 years in the first case and 3 years in the second. The quality of the evidence on which these recommendations are based is defined as very low. Particularly for women aged 45-49, the new European guidelines indicate the need for a research effort, based on comparative studies, on the effectiveness of different screening intervals. This responsibility also falls on Italy, which is the only European country where women aged 45-49 are invited on an annual basis. Therefore, a research project is proposed which includes (1) a controlled, prospective randomized non-inferiority trial to determine the optimal screening interval for women aged 45-49, with and without high mammographic density, (2) a retrospective data collection, with the same purpose, on screening performed by women aged 70-74, and (3) a qualitative research to define the best communication strategy.

To define the best interval for screening women 45-49 years old a three-arm multicenter randomized non-inferiority trial will be conducted. Women signing the written informed consent will be randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio to:

Arm 1: 1-year screening interval; Arm 2: 2-year screening interval; Arm 3: tailored screening interval on the basis of breast density. Women with very dense breast (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System -BI-RADS- category D) will be referred to 1-year interval whereas women with less dense breast to 2-year interval (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System -BI-RADS- category A, B, C).

Enrollment will last 2.5 years and all women will be followed for 6 years. 60,000 women will be enrolled.

The primary objective is to compare the cumulative incidence of stage 2 or higher breast cancer between different screening intervals and this will be evaluated at the end of the 6-year follow-up period.

At the same time, data from all women registered in screening archives who have had a negative mammogram at the age of 69-71 years will be collected and analyzed. The data will be retrieved up to the age of 78 and will concern screening mammograms as well as other screening procedures (e.g. biopsies) and also mammograms performed outside the program. Data from screening and outpatient information systems as well as from cancer registries will be used.

To identify the best strategy to communicate changes in screening protocols, especially when the new protocol would be less intensive than the actual one, a qualitative research will be conducted. In particular the following steps will be considered:

Focus groups for discussing, with women from target population and health care professionals, key arguments identified in a preliminary research (i.e. scientific literature and case-studies research), with particular focus on how they should be translated into communication strategies.
Pre-test of the study's communication material through web-based semi-structured interviews to eligible women and key-informants.

Moreover, screening methods provide binary answers, and therefore does not inform risk profile of the patients.

Traditionally, risk prediction algorithms such as the GAIL model, BODACIEA, and Tyler-Cuzick use medical history and clinical factors of patients. However recently, genetics have grown in importance due to the heritability nature of cancer and availability of testing services and guidelines. About 10-30% of all cases are attributed to familial breast cancers, and of these, only 5%-10% correlate with hereditary factors linked with high penetrance. The most common genetic test to screen today is BRCA 1 and 2, and then other 22 genes curated by expert opinions on NCCN and other guidelines.

The prevalences estimated for carriers of mutations in BRCA1/2 are, respectively, 0.11% and 0.12% in the general population, and between 12.8%-16% in high risk families with three or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer. Approximately 10-15% of ovarian cancer cases are believed to be due to a BRCA1/2 mutation, however ~50% of individuals with a pathogenic BRCA mutation may not report a strong family history of cancer. NCCN, ASCO, St Gallen and has established guidelines to screen patients, but the low awareness in patients to go screening in the first place is hard.

Genetic testing using polygenic risk scores (PRS) combines the effects of low penetrance genes that together creates predictive value as strong as high-penetrance genes, but is much more common than high-penetrance gene testing. A PRS is most commonly calculated as a weighted sum of the number of risk alleles carried by an individual, where the risk alleles and their weights are defined by the loci and their measured effects as detected by genome wide association studies.

For some common adult-onset diseases, the polygenic risk conveyed to a substantial segment (10-20%) of the population whose genomes are enriched in risk alleles is comparable to the risk conveyed by commonly used clinical risk factors. A recent large-scale comprehensive GWAS for breast cancer found that 45% of familial relative risk of breast cancer can be explained by genetic variants captured by genotyping and imputation. As genotyping technologies advance, and consortia build algorithms on more samples, the predictive values of PRS algorithms are maturing. After analysis of 120,000 patients and optimizing for highest predictability, a PRS score combining 313 SNPs and clinical factors have a predictive value of 68%, compared to only 58% using clinical risk factors. A study conducted in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium showed that PRS combined with environmental risk factors can be used to distinguish women at different levels of breast cancer risk in the general population.

This score gives providers the opportunity to stratify the patients may result in some people with higher risk profile to start risk-reducing therapy earlier, start screening at a younger age, and modify their lifestyles with the aim of reducing their risk. For example, those who are at the top 1.5% of polygenic risk score have an odds ratio of 3 or more compared to the general population.

Polygenic risk scores have been applied in leading institutions in the world as clinical trials and in the commercial settings. However, there has been little application in developing countries to use polygenic risk score to increase awareness of risk-reducing strategies of breast cancer in patients.

One of the main concerns about the clinical implementation of population-based genetic screening is experts' availability post-test. A study in the UK for physicians' attitude towards risk stratification of ovarian cancer showed that 70% oncologists and 50% of GPs would be willing to offer genetic testing to their patients. About 60% believe that the test would give patients a sense of control, and over 80% of providers are willing to personalize recommendations based on risk stratification.

The goal of post-treatment imaging surveillance is to detect early second breast cancer, which permits interventions to improve survival and maintain quality of life.

Currently, most guidelines consistently recommend annual mammography for women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC). However, in women with dense breasts, mammographic sensitivity decreased from a level of 85.7%-88.8% in patients with almost entirely fatty tissue to 62.2%-68.1%. Even more, sensitivity of mammography was lower in women with a PHBC within the initial 5 years after primary breast cancer (PBC) treatment. In addition, dense breasts lead to an increased percentage of interval cancer. Thus, the need for a better surveillance modality has emerged.

In this context, breast US may be considered as a supplemental screening modality because it is widely available, does not need contrast agents, and is of relatively lower cost . A few studies indicate that adding screening US to mammography reduced interval cancer rates for women with dense breasts and enable detection of early-stage cancers at an average of 4.2 cancers per 1000 US examinations. As an another candidate, breast MRI shows high sensitivity and offers the highest cancer detection rate but its routine usage in women with a PHBC is still on debate.

Another possible imaging modality is breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest annual screening with mammography and MRI is recommended for ① women with Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutations, ② first-degree family members of carriers of BRCA mutations, ③ women with a lifetime risk of breast cancer greater than 20% based on family history, and ④ women have radiotherapy for thorax at the age of 10-30 years and ⑤ women diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) by previous biopsy. And, this is based on the results of existing single-center or multi-center prospective studies. Women who underwent breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer before the age of 50 were added to the 2018 new MRI screening group of the American College of Radiology (ACR), and their secondary breast cancer risk is 20% or more. Most women with a history of breast cancer have an intermediate risk (>15% but <20%) of developing breast cancer. Therefore, when most patients are not in the high-risk group, performing conventional MRI (full-protocol MRI, FP-MRI) for all postoperative examinations is not appropriate in terms of cost and time.

Abbreviated MRI (AB-MRI), introduced relatively recently, is a method designed to increase accessibility by reducing time and cost by selectively capturing only some sequences in FP-MRI. Sequence composition can be adjusted in various ways, and image acquisition must be completed within 10 minutes. A number of studies have demonstrated that AB-MRI has comparable diagnostic results to FP-MRI. The most recent paper published in Korea compared the scores of 726 patients with AB-MRI and FP-MRI by performing propensity score matching. The results were comparable in sensitivity, and AB-MR was significantly higher in specificity. Other indicators such as interval cancer rate or Breast Imaging Reporting & Data System (BI-RADS) Category 3 rate did not show significant differences between the two groups. However, all studies are retrospective and there are no prospective data. Since the reported scores of AB-MRI and FP-MRI are comparable, it is difficult to test because the sample size is larger than 18,000 in order to perform a non-inferiority test on diagnostic scores. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic results of secondary breast cancer surveillance using mammography, ultrasound, and MRI in a prospective multicenter study.","Inclusion Criteria:

This study is conducted to look into regional ethical predilection, clinical presentation/stage, pathological subtypes & risk factors of BC among patients of Karachi, with the aim of proposing a ground to policy making regarding protocol setting for screening and management of BC for our region.

Methods A prospective cohort single-centered study conducted, which included 500 female patients who attended one surgical unit of a tertiary care public hospital Karachi, during the period of 2010 - 2020. The study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and data collection started after taking hospital ethical review board's approval because personal data of patients was used. Afterwards, informed written consent was taken from every included patient. Prior to collecting data, all researchers were thoroughly trained with regards to data collection and examination of patients to eliminate observer bias. Non probability consecutive sampling technique was used. The allotted patients were followed by same researcher from presentation till the end of follow up to avoid observer bias; through direct patient interaction in OPDs and wards, radiological and histo-pathological results from investigations performed and regular follow up of patients during the complete disease period. The retrieved information was filled on pre designed pro-forma. Patients were preemptively explained about our reason for collecting data and its implications.

Exclusion criteria of the study was; previously treated breast cancer patients, recurrent BC, female ≤19 years, male/transgender, females coming for treatment from other provinces/foreigners.

Thorough history of all patients obtained including relevant risk factors; i-e age, family history of BC, marital status, age at first born baby, parity, age of menarche/menopause, socio-economic status and ethnicity. Detailed physical examination including clinical presentation of breast lump, its size, side (right/left breast) and site, nipple discharge, nipple retraction, skin involvement, fixity to underlying structures, and lymph node status, was carried out in each patient by a single examiner. Patients presenting with a discrete lump, nipple discharge, nipple changes, skin changes, palpable axillary lymph nodes were subjected to further investigation. Ultrasonography and mammogram of the breast, where possible, were performed as initial imaging modality. FNAC/Biopsy, was carried out in all patients to confirm the diagnosis of BC, its subtype and receptors status. For staging; x-ray chest, ultrasound abdomen for liver and pelvis/ CT chest & abdomen were done on case based need. Bone scan was performed in only symptomatic cases. After thorough overall assessment, clinical stage of BC was assigned to each patient, and stage based treatment was carried out in every patient. Patients having localized disease (≤stage 2A) underwent surgical intervention first followed by chemo/radiotherapy, regional disease(≥ stage 2B) had neo-adjuvant followed by surgery, and advanced disease(stage 4) were given palliation.16 Post operatively detailed histological report of specimen and microscopic involvement of the lymph nodes status were also noted.

Primary outcomes of the cohort were age, ethnicity, family history, stage/histological type and menopausal status while secondary outcomes were parity, marriage, symptoms, lump size/site and socioeconomic status. After collecting the required data on pro forma, it was analyzed using descriptive statistics by SPSS version 23.0 software.

,Behavioral: African Immigrant Breast Cancer Education Program,Breast Cancer Education Program,Other,"New York City (NYC) is home to a large and diverse immigrant population. Many of these groups face significant barriers to preventive health care, including lack of insurance, poor health care access and language difficulties. Most African immigrant women are likely to live below the poverty line and have low health literacy, are less likely to have health insurance and visit a doctor, particularly for primary/preventive care. Without access to primary care, many preventive services, such as breast cancer screenings go unattended. The barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening for other minority groups from underserved populations, such as African Americans and Latina women have been studied. Less is known about these for African immigrant women and how to most effectively engage their participation in regular screening. Data of over 2,000 African-born immigrants living in NYC show that 77% report not having health insurance; 75% do not have a primary care physician; and 57% have less than a high school education. As for cancer screening, when corrected for age, 44% have never had a mammogram. Through the study team's unique collaboration with the African Services Committee and the African Advisory Council of the Bronx, two non-governmental community-based service organizations, the study team is poised to have a significant impact on these immigrant women, who have emigrated from more than 20 countries in Africa. This is a population with great need for increased breast cancer knowledge, access to breast cancer screening, and basic medical care. The Health Belief Model (HBM) provides a framework for addressing cultural health barriers by positing that making a decision to engage in a health behavior is determined by weighing perceived threats versus benefits. The long term goal of the proposed project is to conduct a randomized clinical trial that tests the adapted intervention to increase breast cancer screening rates for African-born immigrants. In the short term, the study team plans to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening among African-born immigrants and (2) Culturally adapt and pilot test the Witness Project breast cancer education program for African-born women. Thus, the study team will culturally adapt an effective, innovative intervention to address this significant health disparity in African-born immigrant communities.",Increasing African Immigrant Women's Participation in Breast Cancer Screening,"June 29, 2023",Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Screening,"The goal of Aim 1 is to collect formative data via a mixed methods approach and use those results to culturally adapt the Witness Project for African immigrant populations. Cultural adaptation will follow the stage model outlined by Barrera et al.48 The model includes five stages: 1) information gathering to determine which intervention components to modify; 2) preliminary adaptation design that integrates information from stage 1 to inform preliminary modification of the original intervention; 3) preliminary adaptation tests to pilot the intervention for feasibility and acceptability, 4) adaptation refinement with decisions informed a leadership team/advisory board; and 5) cultural adaptation trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention in changing health outcomes. As this is the first step in this line of research, the proposed study will only follow stages 1-4. The Witness Project has three main components that will be culturally adapted: 1) educational presentation addressing myths, barriers and values related to breast cancer and mammography, 2) culturally matched, peer led narrative about breast cancer experience, 3) experiential education about breast anatomy and self-examination. The quantitative surveys will be conducted first. The results will inform the refinement of the focus group guide and in-depth interview questions. Participant Recruitment for Focus Groups, Interviews and Surveys. There is a tremendous diversity of African nations and languages; focusing research on individual African nations and/or native languages is not feasible within the proposed study. Given that French and English are the most prevalent non-native languages spoken by African immigrants in New York City, the study team has chosen to focus on targeting individuals who speak these languages as a first step in this line of research. All participants will be recruited from African immigrant communities in NYC. Based on the prior experience of the study team's community partners, the majority of the populations that they serve are from Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso. In anticipation of wide variations in cultural values, barriers and benefits, the study team will thus use a maximum variation sampling approach to allow discovery of central themes, core elements and/or shared dimensions that cut across a diverse sample of participants. The study team has a well-established collaborative relationship with gatekeepers in the African immigrant community and have successfully recruited African-born persons into prior studies49 and therefore anticipate successful recruitment for this proposed research. Participants will be recruited for in-depth interviews, focus groups, and surveys through IRB approved flyers at community sites.

Quantitative Surveys: The study team will conduct surveys (N=50) to assess predictors of breast cancer screening among African immigrant women. The survey will be conducted by a bilingual RA and take about 15-30 minutes to Focus Groups: The study team will ask the community partners to assist the team with identifying potential participants for the focus groups. The goal of the focus groups is to gather rich, qualitative data from African immigrant stakeholders and gatekeepers about the breast cancer screening needs of women within their communities. The study team will deliver informational presentations about the focus groups and the proposed study at events and meetings held by the community partners. The study team will conduct one focus group with gatekeepers and stakeholders (in English) and the other two focus groups will be conducted with African immigrant women (in French and English). The focus groups will take 75-90 minutes to complete and will be conducted by a bilingual RA. In-depth Interviews: An RA will approach potential participants and explain the purpose of the study, verify eligibility and obtain informed consent. Participants will be asked to discuss their beliefs about barriers and facilitators patients may face as they consider breast cancer screening. The duration of the in-depth interview and focus group will be approximately one hour including the interview and completion of a demographic questionnaire.

Recruitment and Iterative Program Development: After the completion of the interviews and focus groups in Aim 1, a 3×3 table of themes categorized using the PEN-3 model 25 will be produced for each of the three components of the Witness Project: 1) addressing myths, barriers and values, 2) culturally relevant breast cancer narrative, 3) experiential breast education. Themes will be categorized in the following domains: cultural empowerment and relationships and expectations. These themes will inform how the intervention components for the educational narrative program should be adapted for an African immigrant audience. Cultural barriers identified will also be addressed in the culturally relevant narrative by providing examples and suggestions for coping with these perceived risks. The study team will invite participants (N=20) to give feedback on the first iteration of the educational program components, procedures and feasibility and acceptability of the interventions.

Populations, Sites and Recruitment for Programs: Over the past 20 years, US African immigration has increased ~750% with a high concentration settling in NYC.60,61 Experienced outreach coordinators, assisted by the consultants, will recruit local community, faith-based, and other social organizations to host breast cancer educational programs as the study team has successfully done for previous studies. 24,20 Research staff will focus on sites that include African-born immigrant women 40 years of age and older. A program will be scheduled by the coordinator and individuals at the community sites will be approached to participate in a breast cancer educational program. The study team will emphasize the goal of the programs such that the study team will over recruit those eligible for breast cancer screening. The study team will conduct a total of eight programs in English (N=4) and French (N=4). Based on prior experience, the study team anticipates that about 15 participants will attend each program and of those attendees, 50% will be eligible for breast cancer screening (N=8). Thus, the study team will recruit a total of 64 eligible women at each program. When recruiting program sites, the RA will emphasize the language in which the program will be conducted.

Conducting Educational Intervention Programs: Trained staff will conduct the educational programs. Trained staff will enroll and collect data from English- and French- speaking African-born immigrants working with the consultants. Information and resources about breast cancer, and primary care clinical services will be available to all participants, including the mobile mammography van operated by the institution. The study team will inform both insured and uninsured participants about the Cancer Services Program and local clinical service resources for those without primary care physicians as well as questions to guide them about asking clinicians about breast cancer screenings when they have medical appointments. The program will take approximately 60 minutes to complete. The program will also use a culturally matched peer approach to educate and model successful experiences with mammography screening.","AIM 1:

Primary

Compare the impact of risk-tailored messages vs standard health information on the outcome of mammography in healthy women.

Secondary

Compare the effect of these interventions on breast self-examination, clinical breast exam, risk perceptions, and breast cancer worry.
Compare the mechanism of action of these interventions on participants by assessing the impact of covariants (coping mechanisms, expanded Health Belief Model variables, breast cancer worry, breast cancer risk factors including family history, risk perceptions, discussion of breast cancer with relatives, previous screening practices, intentions to screen, and various demographic variables-age, race, and education) on breast cancer screening.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

Participants are approached to complete a baseline survey while they are waiting for their clinic visits. Baseline surveys measure breast cancer risk factors, current breast cancer screening practices, intentions to screen, risk perceptions, breast cancer worry, coping mechanisms, and discussion of breast cancer with relatives. After completion of the baseline surveys, participants are then randomized to 1 of 2 education arms.

Arm I (intervention group): Participants undergo a computerized risk assessment followed by personalized risk-tailored health messages. Health messages are based on principles of the expanded Health Belief Model (HBM). These messages include screening and lifestyle recommendations, information on the seriousness of breast cancer, instructions on how to arrange a mammography appointment, and contact information for genetic and psychosocial counseling.
Arm II (control group): Participants receive generalized breast health information sheets that contain appropriate screening and lifestyle recommendations for the general public and contact information for genetic and psychosocial counseling.

All participants undergo follow-up assessment by telephone (or by mail if unreachable by phone) at 1, 6, and 18 months after the initial intervention. Self-reported mammography use, additional breast health monitoring practices, risk perception, breast cancer worry, coping mechanisms, HBM-related beliefs, and family communication are measured.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) are the most commonly used serum markers in the diagnosis and follow up of BC, However their clinical applications still remain controversial.

Retinoic acid induced protein 14 (RAI14) is an actin-binding protein which participates in physiological processes such as the regulation of cell polarity and transport of spermatozoa. Recent studies showed that RAI14 is overexpressed in several malignant tumors with a significant role in the development of tumors . The serum RAI14 is a reliable novel marker in the early diagnosis and chemotherapy monitoring of triple-negative BC.

Metastasis-associated colon cancer-1 (MACC-1) is a newly identified tumor marker, first identified in colon cancer tissue as a prognostic indicator and inducer of metastasis .It is located on human chromosome 7 (7p21.1) and shown to be a key regulator of the hepatocyte growth factor-mesenchymal epithelial transition factor( HGF-MET) pathway in colon cancer. It is shown that serum MACC-1 can be a potential biomarker for diagnosis and progression in patients with BC.

Regarding breast cancer, the common screening tool us mammography, which suffer from low sensitivity and high false positive. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing a screening tool for early stages lung and breast cancer.

The sense of smell depends on the ability of specialized sensory cells of the nose to perceive volatile compounds (VOCs). Diseases such as infections and malignancies can be associated with changes in host metabolism, accompanied by production of different VOCs, and thus a different odor. Several studies have shown that different cancers secrete different VOCs, thus produce different smell.

We have developed a system which uses biosensors that can scent the VOCs that lung and breast cancer cell produce, thus distinguish between healthy control and lung or breast cancer. These biosensors can detect low stages lung and breast cancer.

The group that lost significant weight after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and was diagnosed with breast cancer,Diagnostic Test: mammography,significant weight loss+ breast cancer,,"Obesity is an important risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. A large meta-analysis concluded that obesity is associated with a 20% to 40% increased risk for receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer working group on obesity and cancer risk drew similar conclusions. Obesity seems to have the opposite effect among premenopausal women, with most studies suggesting that higher BMI is associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer.

Determining whether deliberate weight loss is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer is difficult in part because sustained weight loss is difficult to achieve and few studies have sufficient statistical power to address this question. Bariatric surgery is one of the few weight loss interventions in which significant weight loss is maintained. A limited number of previous studies have suggested a reduced risk of cancer following bariatric surgery. Recently, it showed that bariatric surgery is associated with a lower risk of several types of cancer, including an approximately 40 % reduction in the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. However, whether bariatric surgery affects breast cancer risk in premenopausal women and whether this association is altered by estrogen receptor (ER) status has not been addressed.

CTCs in peripheral blood originate from breast cancer (primary and metastatic lesions) shedding. Utilization of CTCs as novel and noninvasive tests for diagnosis confirmation, therapy selection, and cancer surveillance is a rapidly growing area of interest. At present, there is a great challenge to create an effective platform that can isolate these cells, as they are extremely rare: only 1-10 CTCs are present in a 7.5mL of a cancer patient's peripheral blood. The majority of the CTC capture methods are based on EpCAM expression as a surface marker of tumor-derived cells. However, EpCAM protein expression levels can be significantly down regulated during cancer progression as a consequence of the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Although many technologies have been reported to achieve the capture and counting of CTCs, these methods study little information of cells and limited biological information can be obtained, leading to a lack in clinical diagnosis.

Microfluidics has demonstrated great potential as an effective technique for the medical and biological sciences. Inspired by the bed topography in river meanders, here, the investigators report a novel river meander-like cross-section in helical microchannels for size-based inertial focusing and enrichment, aiming to realize more functional geometries as well as reduce the extensive laborious requirement in traditional fabrication process. This device can facilitate particle focusing at a larger scale than traditional channels. Compared to the circular, rectangular and trapezoidal channels, the river meander-like microfluidic channel can successfully realize 26 μm particle focusing with a thinner focusing band in a shorter channel length. Also, in a single test, this structure can achieve 85.4% recovery and the enrichment ratio of 1.86 of spiked MDA-MB-231 cells in the whole blood, overcoming the dependence on traditional cell manipulation microfluidic devices. These results indicate that this river meander-like microfluidic chip has the great potential of size-based cell/particle sorting and enrichment for clinical application. Meanwhile, Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has such advantages as high sensitivity, flexible excitation wavelength, high spectral resolution, non-invasiveness to biological samples, resistance self-fluorescence, photobleaching, etc., which is considered as a promising and powerful real-time detection technology for unlabeled cells. But SERS spectrum of cell contains information about different molecules, so it usually requires complex data interpretation. Therefore, the application of Raman spectroscopy combined with chemometrics in biological problems has attracted more and more attention. However, analysis result of chemometrics can be influenced by the complex background of Raman spectroscopy. Therefore, a pre-processing is needed to remove these influencing factors.

Based on these previous work, the investigators have developed a novel technology for the detection of CTCs of breast cancer. The detection platform constructed by the combination of microfluidic chip and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy is used to detect the blood sample of the subject, obtain the high quality of breast cancer circulating tumor cells from the aspects of cell specificity, surface structure and molecular activity of surface-enhanced Raman spectrum information, and extract the characteristics of different breast cancer circulating tumor cells by related signal feature extraction methods, establish a standard surface-enhanced Raman spectral feature database for the main types of breast cancer circulating tumor cells.

This technology aims to build a platform allowing for cell detection, synthesize particles for surface plasmon Raman enhancement, fabricate microfluidic devices, study the collection and analysis of the Raman spectra of CTCs, establish the database of CTC Raman spectra and develop the evaluation method of the biological detection. The primary objective is to demonstrate that the CTC assay counts technology can distinguish between healthy subjects and malignant breast cancer subjects. The secondary objective is to demonstrate that the CTCs detection technology can evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as well as dynamic treatment monitoring and prognosis evaluation.","Inclusion Criteria:

Breast cancer patients who are BRCA mutation carriers have up to a 65% risk for a new primary breast cancer in the future. Additionally, BRCA mutation carriers have a 10-45% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer.

Effective options to decrease these high future cancer risks are available to breast cancer patients who learn they carry a BRCA mutation - including prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy reduce the risks for future primary breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively, by more than 90%. Because of the high risks for future cancer and the opportunity for effective risk reduction among mutation carriers, national guidelines consistently recommend referral of breast cancer patients at increased risk for hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling by a qualified genetics professional. Lack of implementation of this standard of care constitutes an error of omission and jeopardizes patient outcomes.

We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare a ""passive intervention"" - dissemination of professional guidelines - with an ""active intervention"" - a multi-faceted provider education and decision support intervention to improve 1) appropriate referral of breast cancer patients at risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community cancer center setting and 2) pre-surgical referral among newly diagnosed patients.

The convenience and easy accessibility of the data and information received through mobile phones have made mobile applications as the latest trend to provide education for patients in medical centers. In Taiwan, breast cancer incidence has been the highest among all cancers and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Women with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy suffer from a number of symptoms throughout the chemotherapy treatment that detrimentally affects their quality of life. Thus, providing social support and nursing care aids for these vulnerable women is imperative to help them face their breast cancer challenges. This study will develop a Mobile device application providing medical care information and social support for breast cancer women during their chemotherapy treatment to help them receive individually tailored information related to chemotherapy and support from healthcare professionals and peers. This study will use a mixed-methods design to develop a Mobile device application based on breast cancer literature and the clinical experiences of breast cancer patients to fulfill the needs women may experience during the chemotherapy treatment. Women with breast cancer will be invited to help refine the Mobile device application's content based on their experiences and feedback about the mobile application. Upon completing the mobile application development, women with breast cancer patients will be recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of the mobile application.

Currently, patients are exposed to different information given by the professionals' personal styles of informing patients. The challenge for all oncological professionals is to give clear, structured, and neutral information on the pros and cons of the treatment option(s) in the context of the natural course of the disease to the patient; to elicit patients' needs and preferences. How and which information should be shared in a decision aid is up for investigation, as well as how this should best be implemented.

Research goals: Qualitative assessment of patients' and health care professionals' informational needs and perspectives on breast cancer radiotherapy and shard decision making.

Methods: Semi-structured interviews will be held with both breast cancer patients and health care professionals. To reach as heterogeneous groups as possible patients of different ages, with different education levels and who underwent different treatments or chose not to get radiotherapy at all will be selected . Data will be collected til saturation is reached. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.

Results: Results of the qualitative study are expected at the beginning of 2017.

The incidence of breast cancer is higher in developed countries than in developing countries, but the numbers of deaths due to breast cancer are lower in developed countries than in developing countries.

It is known that breast self-examination, clinical breast examination and mammography play an important role in making an early diagnosis of breast cancer. The uptake rate for mammography performed on a regular basis is low because this is an expensive method, considering that not all individuals have health insurance and public funding is inadequate, especially in developing countries.

Other factors that contribute to planning adjuvant systemic therapy include, tumor size3, grade3, hormone receptor status4, Her2/neu overexpression5-7, proliferation markers8-9, age at presentation, patient preferences, performance status and comorbidities. Accurate survival estimates, and the likely benefit of adjuvant therapy, are important aspects of information oncologists consider when making decisions following surgery for invasive, early breast cancer. Currently these decisions are based on known pathological prognostic factors including tumour size, tumour grade and lymph node status in addition to the relative risk reductions of any adjuvant therapy1-7.

The prognostic and predictive strengths of different factors are variable and the same factor can have different predictive or prognostic value according to the molecular subtype of breast cancer. These markers are not completely independent of each other10.

Several predictive models are now available to help estimate the survival and treatment benefits for individual patients.Multivariate Prediction Models (MPM) takes into consideration not just each marker but the effect with all possible combinations of these markers10. MPMs are of two types. They can either be multivariate prognostic model or a multigene predictive model. Examples10 of multivariate prognostic models are IHC4 assay, Adjuvant! Online and PREDICT. Multigene predictive models are OncotypeDx, MammaPrint, PAM50, EndoPredict.

Web based mathematical models which use algorithms to predict survival with or without systemic therapy after surgery, like 'Adjuvant! Online' and PREDICT V2.0 use patient characteristics to predict the survival with or without treatment. The inputs required are tumour size, number of nodes involved, grade of tumour, hormone receptor status, Her2 overexpression, Ki67 and comorbidities. Based on these inputs using an algorithm these tools calculate the overall survival at end of 5 and/or 10 years. Then they also predict what would be the added benefit of adjuvant systemic therapies singularly or with combinations.

However majority of these models that have been evaluated use the datasets of cancer registries in a particular geographical location or singles institute11,12. This makes blind application of these models to untested populations unpredictable. Various studies have tested web based prognostic models in different populations. In 2011 Hajage D, et al published their results regarding external validation of 'Adjuvant! Online',in a French and Dutch population13. The prediction was overall well-calibrated in the French data. But there was discordance in some subgroups of patients having high grade tumours and HER2 overexpression. Addition of HER2 status, Mitotic Index and Ki67 significantly improved the predictions. In the Dutch data set, the overall 10-year survival was overestimated by 'Adjuvant! Online', particularly in patients less than 40 years of age.Bhoopathyet al, in 2012 tested this tool in an Asian population and concluded that although it differentiates between good and bad prognosis, it systematically overestimates the survival and requires adaptation before usage in Asian population14.

Predict is an online prognostication and treatment benefit tool developed in the UK, using cancer registration and survival data recorded by the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre (ECRIC) for 5694 women diagnosed in East Anglia from 1999-2003.15The model was validated in a second cohort of 5468 women from the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit and is available online (www.predict.nhs.uk) providing 5-and 10-year survival estimates and treatment benefit predictions. Wong et al, tested the predictive accuracy of PREDICT V1.0 in the southeast Asian population16. There were 67% Chinese patients while 13% were Indians. The median age in their study was 50 yrs. They showed concordance in observed and predicted OS in most subgroups except for women whore less than 40 years of age. After reviews in literature, for a better fit in various groups, PREDICT V1.0 was updated to version v2.0. V2.0 is equivalent to V1.0 but calibration of V2.0 has improved over V1.0 in patients diagnosed under the age of 40.17

Multigene predictive models like OncotypeDx, MammaPrint, PAM50, EndoPredict are restrictive in their use due to high cost, thus many oncologists in India use the freely available Web based mathematical models, like Adjuvant Online! or PREDICT V2.0. However, there is no data suggesting the validity of prediction using these models in Indian patients.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 14.1 million cases and 8.2 million deaths per year. Approximately 1 in 4 deaths in the United States are due to cancer, however, the cancer burden has increased over time and continues to increase in both developed and developing countries due to an aging and growing population, accelerated socioeconomic development, and changes in the prevalence of associated risk factors.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and one of the three most common types of cancer worldwide, along with lung and colon cancer, usually detected either by screening or by a symptom (for example, pain or a palpable mass) that warrants a diagnostic examination. Advances in screening and treatment methods enable the diagnosis of this disease in its early stages. The primary treatment for early-stage breast cancer is surgery with adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy. However, these treatments also cause side effects such as pain, fatigue and sleep disorders. Such effects can significantly worsen the patient's health-related quality of life, especially in the immediate post-operative period.

Due to advances in systemic therapies, widely used screening programs, and the high incidence of breast cancer, the number of women who survive breast cancer is constantly increasing. Many of these women have multiple, complex and unique healthcare needs. Women who have completed their treatment have difficulty returning to their normal lives, often feel 'abandoned' and report that their health care needs are not adequately met. This is among the important problems affecting the lives of breast cancer survivors and their families.

The most important problems encountered at the end of breast cancer treatment are cardiotoxicity, pain, fatigue, lymphedema, cognitive impairment, early menopause, distress, depression and anxiety, neuropathy, infertility, musculoskeletal system problems, and osteoporosis. It is especially important to take precautions against such effects, as the survival rate is increasing.

Although physical activity is often used as an adjunctive therapy to alleviate disease and treatment-related symptoms during chemotherapy and radiotherapy, its effects such as improvement in patients' physical function, vitality, strength and quality of life, reduced risk of developing lymphedema, decreased depression, fatigue and pain, and reduced psychological complaints cannot be ignored, physical activity is also associated with a reduced risk of relapse and a better survival. Exercise programs have also been shown to improve mental health-related quality of life among breast cancer survivors who have completed cancer treatment.

Exercise is an effective non-pharmacological method to reduce the deleterious effects of breast cancer treatments on cardiovascular health, by modifying cardiovascular risk factors and potentially reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.

In a study evaluating quality of life, quality of supportive care services, and perceived safety against 18 potential cancer-related health problems among young women under follow-up after cancer diagnosis, breast cancer survivors reported significantly worse quality of life among different types of cancer. In the study, it was concluded that although 78% of the post-cancer survivors were willing to know about the treatment and the late effects of cancer, only 36% of the people received information about these effects.

In the study, which was conducted to determine the continuing needs and concerns of women over the years by interviewing individuals with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy, very few women reported that despite advances in cancer care services and advances in patient-centered care, they were informed about some of the potential outcomes of radiotherapy in addition to treatment procedures, and that they were not warned against common late effects such as ongoing fatigue and pain.

In a study conducted to determine the knowledge and awareness of colorectal cancer survivors about the long-term and late-term consequences of treatment, it was revealed that the participants were not aware of the risks of complications other than recurrence. Some of the participants noted how things might change after surgery, that other aspects of their treatment were less well explained, while others said they were unsure whether their current symptoms were cancer-related and wanted to be warned about some of the things the process might affect before they experienced it.

In the study, which aimed to determine the level of awareness of lymphedema related to breast cancer in women with breast cancer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an online questionnaire was distributed and data were collected. In addition, it was concluded that the level of awareness and quality of life were related.

It has been demonstrated that there is a need for the development of an early education program on the possibility of developing lymphedema in women who have undergone breast cancer surgery and who have received chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and customized educational interventions using different materials to improve knowledge, perception and awareness about tumor and treatment outcomes. Early diagnosis is important in order to improve the quality of life of patients and to achieve a better outcome in women with breast cancer, and for this reason, it is necessary to determine and increase the awareness level of patients. In addition, since there is a serious relationship between the awareness level of women with breast cancer and their improvement in their quality of life, it has been reported that future studies should investigate the relationship between the awareness level of lymphedema and improving the quality of life of women with breast cancer. As far as we know, subjective questions were used while evaluating the effects and awareness of these effects in individuals with breast cancer in previous studies, and there is no scale developed and used for this purpose.

In this direction, the aim of this study is to develop a scale that evaluates the awareness levels of individuals diagnosed with breast cancer with a high incidence and survival, especially for the effects that may occur in the short and/or long term, especially physiotherapy-related effects. At the same time, it is planned to use the quality of life parameter, which has been proven to be related to the level of awareness, in determining the content validity of this developed scale.

The participant group of this research will consist of women diagnosed with breast cancer, and participation will be based on a voluntary basis.

The first step for the scale development study is to create an item pool by utilizing a literature review on the designated topic. After the item pool is created, experts from the relevant field will be selected, and the items prepared with the ""Expert Evaluation Form"" will be assessed for their relevance to the intended measurement topic. After the expert evaluation, the Content Validity Ratio will be calculated to determine whether the items should be removed from or retained in the scale, and for the entire test, the Content Validity Index will be obtained. Subsequently, the preparation stage of the measurement tool will be initiated. In this stage, a scale guideline will be written, items will be placed within the test, and the format of scale options will be determined.

Once the scale has obtained approval from the expert group, a pilot test will be conducted on a small sample group to assess its performance. Item analysis using relevant statistical methods will be conducted for the initial pilot application. After these steps, the scale will reach its final form.

Following the finalization of the scale, a sample group representing the target population will be determined, along with the appropriate sample size. The sample size will be selected to be 5-10 times the number of items in the final scale, as recommended. After determining the sample group size, the application of the scale to the relevant group within the research scope will take place. Following the administration, an evaluation of the items and a preliminary examination of their performance will be conducted. This stage includes statistical calculations such as item-total correlations, item variances, and item means. In the subsequent stage after factor and item analysis, if necessary, final adjustments will be made regarding the content and format of the scale. By following these steps, the process of scale development will be completed.

To assess the awareness levels of individuals regarding the effects of cancer treatments, particularly related to physiotherapy, a pool of 50 questions was created based on relevant guidelines from the International Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and American Society of Clinical Oncology. These questions were formulated considering the potential effects that may occur in any period after the treatment. Additionally, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EORTC QLQ-BR23, specific to breast cancer, will be used for the criterion validity of the developed scale.","Inclusion Criteria:

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and other professional organizations recommend that clinicians discuss chemoprevention with high-risk women. Breast cancer chemoprevention with anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole, is under-utilized, despite several randomized controlled trials demonstrating a 40-65% decrease in breast cancer incidence among high-risk women. Compounding this underutilization is the fact that a large proportion of women may be unaware of their high-risk status due to the investigators inability to adequately screen them in the primary care setting. Further research is needed to determine how knowledge about breast cancer, actual/perceived risk, and risks/benefits of chemoprevention are best communicated to women in order to promote breast cancer prevention strategies.

This study assesses risk communication and shared decision-making in patient-clinician dyads by administering validated measures at baseline, after interacting with the tools prior to the clinic visit, and after the clinical visit (quantitative analysis); and by using observer-based methods of audio-tape recordings of their clinical encounters (qualitative analysis).

It is a pragmatic trial in which each participating centre can use the local predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria for entry into the trial. Only centres with access to the Intrabeam® (Carl Zeiss) are eligible to enter patients into the trial.

Eligible patients are those with a higher risk of local recurrence after breast conserving surgery.

The protocol recommends that patients be followed at six monthly intervals for three years and then annually.

Secondary endpoints are relapse-free survival, site of recurrence, overall survival (breast-cancer specific and non-breast cancer deaths) patient satisfaction and quality of life.",A Comparison of Intra-operative Radiotherapy Boost With External Beam Radiotherapy Boost in Early Breast Cancer.,April 2022,Anticipated,Early Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Parallel Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,"DESIGN: A pragmatic multi-centre randomised clinical trial to test whether TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy as a tumour bed Boost (TARGIT-B) is superior in terms of local relapse within the treated breast compared with standard post-operative external beam radiotherapy boost in women undergoing breast conserving therapy who have a higher risk of local recurrence. Patients can be entered before the primary surgery or in a smaller proportion of cases, post-pathology. SETTING: Specialist breast units in UK, USA, Canada, Australia and Europe; 31 centres currently recruiting in the TARGIT-A trial and several are ready to join. TARGET POPULATION: Breast cancer patients suitable for breast conserving surgery, but with a high risk of local recurrence. Details of inclusion and exclusion are given in part 2. Briefly the patients should be either younger than 45 or if older, need to have certain pathological features that confer a high risk of local recurrence of breast cancer. HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BEING ASSESSED. The TARGIT Technique: The Intrabeam® (Carl Zeiss, FDA approved and CE marked) is a miniature electron beam-driven source which provides a point source of low energy X-rays (50kV maximum) at the tip of a 3.2mm diameter tube. The radiation source is inserted into the tumour bed immediately after excision of the tumour and switched on for 20-35 minutes to provide intra-operative radiotherapy accurately targeted to the tissues that are at highest risk of local recurrence. The physics, dosimetry and early clinical applications of this soft x-ray device have been well studied. For use in the breast, the technique was first developed and piloted at University College London. The radiation source is surrounded by a spherical applicator, specially designed (and available in various sizes) to produce a uniform field of radiation at its surface, enabling delivery of an accurately calculated dose to a prescribed depth. It is inserted in the tumour bed and apposed to it with surgical sutures and/or other means. As the x-rays rapidly attenuate the dose to more distant tissues is reduced; this also allows it to be used in standard operating theatres. 20 Gy is delivered to the tumour bed surface in 20-35 minutes, after which the radiation is switched off, the applicator removed, and the wound closed in the normal way. This simple technique has potentially several advantages over convential external beam radiotherapy, interstitial implantation of radioactive wires or conformal external beam radiotherapy. The first pilot of twenty-five cases was at performed at UCL using TARGIT technique as a replacement for the boost dose of radiotherapy; full dose external beam treatment was subsequently given. The phase II study of 300 patients was published and recently updated with long term data along with favourable toxicity and cosmetic outcome results of individual cohorts. A mathematical model of TARGIT developed recently (funded by Cancer Research UK) suggests that it could be superior to conventional radiotherapy. Translational research has found that TARGIT impairs the surgical-trauma-stimulated proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. This effect of radiotherapy may act synergistically with its tumouricidal effect yielding a superior result. MEASUREMENT OF COST AND OUTCOME: Patient assessments will be clinical examination (6 monthly x 3 years then yearly x 10 years) and mammography (yearly). with ulstrasound (if needed) . Primary outcome: histologically/cytologically proven local recurrence. Secondary: site of relapse in the breast, overall survival, local toxicity (RTOG and LENT SOMA criteria), cosmesis, quality of life, patient satisfaction and health economics. The cost and cost-effectiveness of TARGIT versus EBRT, both as boost, will be calculated from a NHS and personal social services (PSS) perspective. Costs directly incurred by patients will also be assesed, since EBRT as a boost is likely to impose additional time and travel expense to patients and families.","Inclusion Criteria:

Indicators to assess the risk of relapse or metastasis during treatment are still largely insufficient, a situation which does not allow to precisely adjust the treatment, often leading to heavy side effects. In order to minimize the side effects and risks of therapies, it is therefore necessary to discover new markers which would enable us to reliably assess the prognosis of patients diagnosed with breast cancer.

The approach used here for discovering new prognostic markers is based on an original strategy developed by the researchers associated with this project and published in the respective contexts of lung cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma. Indeed, genetic abnormalities and deregulation of the systems controlling the expression of specific gene programs not only lead to the abnormal extinction of normally active genes, but is also responsible for the aberrant activation of genes that normally should remain silent. The investigators have recently demonstrated that any type of malignancy is associated with the ectopic expression of these normally silent genes, including genes of the male germline. The in-depth study of these aberrant gene expressions and the search for correlations and associations with the clinical and biological data of the tumors show that the expression of some of these genes and the presence of their products are good indicators of tumor aggressiveness.

The investigators propose here to apply the same approach for the search for new prognostic markers in the case of breast cancer. A prior analysis of breast tumors, of which transcriptome data are publicly available, has identified a number of tissue-specific genes, including the germline and placenta genes, frequently activated in breast cancer. Based on our past observations, our hypothesis is that some of them may directly reflect the level of tumor aggressiveness and could therefore be used as prognostic biomarkers.

The objective of this work will be to look for the prognostic value of these genes by using the samples collected in this cohort of patients to detect their activation and to correlate these aberrant activations with the anatomopathological data of the tumor, as well as to the clinico-biological data and patient follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria:

Latino cancer survivors have a lower quality of life, experience distress due to strained spousal and family relationships, have poorer physical health, and have more depression, pain, and fatigue when compared to non-Latinos. In addition, emotional and mental well-being between Latino survivors and their partners is related, with partners also experiencing increased distress and physical symptoms. Research has shown that couples-based psychosocial programs improve the quality of life and emotional and physical health of cancer survivors and their partners. Yet, much of the in this area has focused on non-Hispanic Whites. Features of Latino culture may influence and interact with social, psychosocial, health care, and clinical factors that influence cancer-related outcomes. Our goal is to add to this literature and develop a program for Latina breast cancer survivors and their partners that is culturally meaningful and relevant and responds to their needs and concerns.

Specifically, investigators plan to culturally adapt a widely-available and effective online couple intervention, OurRelationship (ORI), for Latina breast cancer survivors and their intimate partners. The online OR program - which can be done on a smartphone, tablet, or computer - was developed to serve as an online tool to help couples solve a specific relationship problem they selected. Investigators will adapt the OR program to be useful for Latina breast cancer survivors and their intimate partners using feedback from focus groups with patients, community partners, and research advisors. Once investigators have completed our adaptation, the plan to test the impact of the adapted program, Together after Cancer, using a type of study called a randomized controlled trial where participants will be randomly allocated to either receive the culturally adapted intervention or usual care. Investigators are interested in learning if couples in the group that are assigned to the intervention program report changes in their relationship functioning, psychological functioning (depression, anxiety, and perceived stress), and cancer-related quality of life (pain, fatigue, body image, and quality of life) compared to couples who are assigned to the UC group.

Through this comparative study, investigators expect to establish effective strategies that can be implemented in clinic and community settings to improve psychological functioning, relationship functioning, and quality of life. Investigators are enthusiastic about the potential for the intervention program to easily reach cancer Latina survivors around the nation, due to the online format and ease of access from any location.

This demonstrates a definite need for support in this specific population. However, survivorship programs that are increasingly instituted at cancer centers have serious impediments to providing information and coaching/support because of the lack of staff time and insurance reimbursement. Furthermore, the pressure of fast-paced clinical patient-provider interactions leaves little time for health care providers to provide up-to-date information and coaching or support for these women based on their cultural attitudes. All these circumstances necessitate an innovative and creative delivery method of information and coaching/support. A technology-based approach using computers and mobile devices (smart phones and tablets) promises to meet this necessity with high flexibility and accessibility, and minimizes the cost of the intervention in busy and costly health care settings. Also, a technology-based intervention that does not involve face-to-face interactions could work better for many women from cultures where breast cancer is still a stigmatizing experience. Therefore, based on preliminary studies, the research team has developed and pilot-tested a theory-driven technology-based information and coaching/support program that is culturally tailored to Asian American breast cancer survivors using multiple features. The purpose of the proposed randomized intervention study is to test the efficacy of the technology-based information and coaching/support program for Asian American breast cancer survivors (TICAA) in enhancing the women's breast cancer survivorship experience. The specific aims are to: a) determine whether the intervention group will show significantly greater improvements than the control group in primary outcomes (needs for help, physical and psychological symptoms, and quality of life) from baseline (pre-test) to Time Points 1 (post 1-month) and 2 (post 3-months); b) identify theory-based variables (attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and social influences related to breast cancer survivorship) that mediate the intervention effects of the TICAA on the primary outcomes at the three time points (pre-test, post 1-month and post 3-months); and c) determine whether the effects of the TICAA on the primary outcomes are moderated by background characteristics and disease factors. The proposed study will be guided by the Bandura's Theory of Behavioral Change. This study adopts a randomized repeated measures pretest/posttest control group design in 330 Asian American breast cancer survivors. The long-term goals are to: (a) implement the program into various health care settings; (b) determine if the TICAA will lead to long-term improved health outcomes; and (c) fundamentally enhance the methodology/paradigm of culturally tailored technology-based interventions for ethnic minority groups of breast cancer survivors.","Inclusion Criteria:

Primary

To determine the efficacy of allogeneic large multivalent immunogen (LMI) vaccine and aldesleukin, as defined by clinical benefit rate (percentage of patients demonstrating a complete response, partial response, or disease stabilization as assessed by RECIST criteria), in women with stable metastatic breast cancer.

Secondary

To measure the immune response in patients treated with this regimen.
To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.
To determine the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates in patients treated with this regimen.
To determine the safety profile and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive allogeneic large multivalent immunogen (LMI) vaccine intradermally on day 1 and aldesleukin subcutaneously on days 7 and 8. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression after 2 courses of vaccine therapy resume the chemotherapy regimen for which prior disease stabilization was achieved. Beginning 2-4 days after completion of chemotherapy, patients receive one dose of LMI vaccine followed by aldesleukin on days 7 and 8. Patients achieving at least stable disease continue to receive LMI vaccine and aldesleukin as above. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples are collected periodically for research studies. Samples are analyzed to assess the frequency of leukocyte subsets (including B cells, T cells, NK cells, and monocytes) via flow cytometry; frequency of T-regs (T cells that express CD4, CD25, and FoxP3); and responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and tetanus toxoid via ELISA assay.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and other professional organizations recommend that clinicians discuss chemoprevention with high-risk women. Breast cancer chemoprevention with anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole, is under-utilized, despite several randomized controlled trials demonstrating a 40-65% decrease in breast cancer incidence among high-risk women. Compounding this underutilization is the fact that a large proportion of women may be unaware of their high-risk status due to the investigators' inability to adequately screen them in the primary care setting. Further research is needed to determine how knowledge about breast cancer, actual/perceived risk, and risks/benefits of chemoprevention are best communicated to women in order to promote breast cancer prevention strategies.

The investigators hypothesize that combining a patient-centered decision aid with a physician-centered decision support tool integrated into clinic workflow will improve accuracy of breast cancer risk perception, facilitate referrals for specialized risk counseling, and increase chemoprevention uptake. We anticipate that the BNAV tool will facilitate referrals to the breast clinic by primary care providers (PCPs) and that the RealRisks decision aid will prime high-risk women to seek these referrals.

RT treatments have led to improved local control and overall survival of breast cancer patients. However, the incidence of radiation induced harmful effects is increasing in these patients. This is because in delivering RT, it is difficult to completely avoid surrounding non-cancerous normal tissue, including the heart. The main concern here is that radiation induced effects on the heart may lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in a patient's life, potentially many years after radiation. Despite methods that can detect alterations in blood flow one to two years following radiotherapy, knowledge of early radiation effects to the heart is still limited. A previous animal experiment performed by our group involved delivering a radiation dose to the heart in a manner similar to the way a heart would be exposed, during radiotherapy for a cancer involving the left breast. Taking several images over the months following radiation with a new imaging technique, hybrid PET/MRI, has suggested an increase in inflammation can be detected as early as one-week following irradiation and may be the triggering event for cardiac disease seen in women 10-15 years after radiotherapy. The investigators propose a pilot study where 15 left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy will be imaged before, as well as one week and one-year post radiotherapy with our hybrid PET/MRI scanner. Areas of inflammation, changes in blood flow, and scar formation within the heart, will be measured by looking at the difference between images that are taken after radiation treatment to the images taken before treatment. The expectation is that any areas of the heart that show detectable differences in the images will be directly related to how much radiation was deposited in those areas. The information gained from this pilot study which will correlate the amount of radiation administered to the degree and extent of injury will help aid in the design of new treatment strategies, that can hopefully decrease or eliminate inadvertent heart damage, thereby, improving the quality of life for breast cancer patients.",Hybrid PET/MR Imaging of Acute Cardiac Inflammation After Left-Sided Breast Cancer Radiotherapy,"December 31, 2021",Anticipated,Left-Sided Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,"Goals: The overall goal of this study is to identify the presence of acute low-dose radiation induced cardiac toxicity, including inflammation, in left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy using hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methodology: A imaging pilot study composed of 15 left-sided breast cancer patients receiving standard radiotherapy is proposed. Patients will be imaged at baseline, within the first month post radiotherapy, and within the first-year post radiotherapy using a hybrid 3T-PET/MRI system (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare). The PET imaging protocol is designed to assess changes in both myocardial perfusion and inflammation. The MR imaging protocol, acquired simultaneously, will be used to identify heart volume, wall motion, mature fibrosis or scar.

Outcome: The findings of this studies will validate the utility of hybrid PET/MRI to detect early inflammatory response, changes in myocardial perfusion, and heart function as a function of radiation dose in a human breast cancer population. This will allow consideration of new techniques to minimize or eliminate heart complications to future cancer patients and provide a non-invasive technique to serially image patients post radiotherapy and to investigate the effect of new interventions.

,Biological: HyperAcute - Breast cancer vaccine,Vaccine group,Experimental,"This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with breast cancer with the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Breast cancer vaccine. It will establish the proper vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The vaccine contains killed breast cancer cells containing a mouse gene that causes the production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the tumor to remain stable or shrink.

Patients 18 years of age or older with breast cancer that has recurred or no longer responds to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if needed.

Participants will receive four vaccinations a month apart from each other. The vaccines will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be safe in Phase I. Weekly blood samples will be drawn during the 4 months of vaccine treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 2 months for the first year after vaccination and then every 3 months for the next 2 years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:

Medical history and physical examination
Blood tests
X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI)
FACT-B Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment, before each vaccination, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It includes questions on the severity of breast cancer symptoms and the ability to perform normal activities of daily life.",Vaccine Treatment for Advanced Breast Cancer,September 2007,Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,"According to 2002 statistics of the American Cancer Society, an estimated 203,500 individuals will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,600 will die of the disease this year despite all current therapy. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to breast cancer gene therapy using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in attempt to vaccinate patients against their breast cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1,3) galactosyltransferase [alpha (1,3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha (1,3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with relapsed or refractory breast cancer will undergo a series of four intradermal injections with a vaccine composed of irradiated allogeneic breast cancer cell lines (HAB-1 and HAB-2) that have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha (1,3) GT gene.

WP 1. Analysis of primary tumor.

Analysis of primary tumor and metastases (Pathology group). In this work package both DNA and RNA from the primary tumors of 125 high-risk (Luminal-B) patients will be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Furthermore, the investigators will also analyze DNA and RNA from the available metastatic lesions (currently material available for 3/8) that have appeared, and will appear during the study period.

MiRNA and mRNA will be profiled using PureLink™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen), Dynabeads mRNA direct micro kit (Ambion),) and Ion total RNA-seq kit V2 (Life Technologies) on our Ion Proton NGS instrument. Bioinformatic analyses of paired mRNA and microRNA expression profiles will be used to reveal differentially expressed microRNAs between patients with and without recurrences under treatment. These data will be linked to our previous studies and used to identify target candidates for microRNA analysis in exosomes and TEPs.

In addition, NGS will also be performed on DNA from the primary tumors and metastases to verify DNA mutations especially in ER and other known oncogenes, including those examined in WP3. The DNA sequencing will be performed using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay. This is an amplicon based approach analyzing hotspot SNVs, indels, and CNVs. These analyses will provide us with a biological understanding and background knowledge for each of the individual tumor, and these datasets can also be compared to the recently published data.

WP 2. Circulating tumor celles (CTC).

Circulating tumor cells (Oncology group) Circulating tumor cells are being enriched from peripheral blood samples by density centrifugation and subsequent immunomagnetic depletion of leucocytes. The oncology group has recently developed and published a new depletion method, termed MINDEC (Multi- marker Immuno- magnetic Negative Depletion Enrichment of CTCs), which has superior recovery and enrichment rates. RNA and DNA are isolated simultaneously from the enriched fraction, to allow CTC detection by both RNA and DNA-based approaches. Specific mRNA markers, with high levels in tumor cells and low levels in normal leukocytes, are being pre-amplified and quantified by real-time PCR as surrogate markers for CTCs. Both epithelial-specific markers and markers related to epithelial mesenchymal transition are part of the marker panel. Until now, the investigatorshave analyzed 170 consecutive blood samples from the larger PBCB cohort, enriched by the MINDEC procedure and found evidence for CTCs in about 20% of the samples (from both low- and high-risk patients), a finding that encourages us to continue this project. The investigators have also analyzed blood samples from 30 healthy female volunteers for comparison. All collected blood samples from 125 high-risk patients will be analyzed (around 575 samples). The presence or level of CTCs in the analyzed samples will later be compared to known prognostic factors, treatment effect and disease outcome.

WP 3. circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

Tumor-specific mutations can be utilized as markers for ctDNA because they are not present in normal cells and normal plasma DNA. The oncology group has recently demonstrated the clinical relevance of ctDNA measurements in pancreatic cancer. The investigators will now measure ctDNA levels in plasma samples from high-risk breast cancer patients by targeted next-generation sequencing. The recently released ""Oncomine breast cfDNA assay"" (Thermo Fisher) will be used to detect mutations in a panel of ten genes that are frequently mutated in breast cancer. The assay is based on molecular barcoding of templates and allows reproducible detection of mutations down to 0,1% control samples. Taking the low concentration of cell free DNA (=cfDNA) in plasma into account (typically 10 ng per ml blood), a sensitivity of 0,1% is considered sufficient. The sequencing will be performed on our Ion Proton NGS instrument (Life Technologies). The pre-operative blood sample and yearly follow-up samples from the 125 high-risk patients will be analyzed in this WP. Blood samples from 30 healthy female volunteers have already been collected and will be analyzed for comparison.

The presence and level of tumor-specific mutations will be analyzed in relation to treatment effect and disease outcome. The mutational profile in the primary tumor biopsy and the plasma samples will be compared in order to reveal potential heterogeneity. In addition, longitudinal changes in the mutation profile of ctDNA will be compared with disease development to potentially shed some light on the biological mechanisms causing treatment resistance or late disease relapses.

WP 4. microRNA (miRNA)

Circulating microRNA from exosomes and TEPs (Pathology group) Total RNA will be isolated from exosomes and TEPs from the blood samples taken before and during treatment. The investigators have recently established methods for isolation of total RNA from exosomes (using exoRNeasy serum Plasma kit (Qiagen) and miRCURY RNA isolation kit (Exiqon)) and TEPs. Using the mentioned protocol, total RNA from exosomes has already been isolated from all the 125 high risk patients first visit/before treatment, additionally from the last blood samples collected will from these patients, total RNA will be isolated from both exosomes and TEPs. Furthermore, microRNA profile will be performed on the isolated RNA using the pipeline and platform already established for our Ion Proton instrument. These profiles will be compared with the bioinformatic analysis of mRNA-miRNA profiles from the primary tumor (WP1) and the samples taken before treatment. MicroRNA that are not present in the tissue sample and/or in the blood sample before treatment, but do appear in blood right before a recurrence appears can then be retrospectively traced in previous blood samples in order to see how sensitive these microRNAs are in predicting treatment resistance. MicroRNA profile from TEPs will be compared to the microRNA profile from exosomes and to the mRNA-miRNA profiles from the primary tumor (WP1, to see if TEPs reflects the tumor and if they have the potential to predict relapse.

WP 5. Metabolomics

Metabolomics is the study of small molecules comprising substrates, intermediates and end products of cellular metabolism, such as amino acids, sugars and small organic acids. The metabolic state of cancer cells is substantially altered compared to normal cells, a fact that can be utilized for diagnostic purposes. Specific metabolic signatures from tumor tissue provide additional information for determination of breast cancer subtypes and prediction of outcome1. For example, increased tumor lactate and glycine levels are related to poor prognosis in patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive cancer. Metabolomic analyses of primary tumors have also demonstrated predictive value in relation to neoadjuvant treatment of patients with locally advanced disease.

Circulating metabolites have also been shown to provide prognostic information in operable breast cancer and further stratify risk within existing genetically determined risk categories. Importantly, metabolomic alterations may arise directly or indirectly from micrometastatic disease, rather than primary tumor. Recently, the investigators have shown that systemic lactate and pyruvate levels predict inferior outcome in patients with operable ER-positive breast cancers. Tumor-adjacent tissue and immunological responses may also contribute to an altered metabolomic profile. There is also evidence that metabolic profiling can be used for patient monitoring in some cancers, although such evidence is still lacking in breast cancer. Therefore, the investigators intend to investigate whether postoperative monitoring by means of metabolic profiling in blood is useful for early detection of breast cancer recurrence.

WP 6. Integrative molecular monitoring for recurrence detection

New technology has revolutionized the level of biological information that can be obtained from clinical samples, represented by the new ""omics"" terms genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc. The availability of such big datasets, even in the public domain, has encouraged the development of integrative methods that can extract vital information from multiple combined data sources. Surprising new connections between omics-datasets have been revealed by such approaches, exemplified by a link between cell-free DNA fragmentation and gene expression46. Accordingly, our knowledge about breast cancer has also been extended by integrative approaches, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the disease. The prognostic subclassification of breast cancers has for instance been refined and novel tumor-specific antigens identified. Integrated molecular data have even been shown to have a higher prognostic power than separate molecular levels in breast cancer. Thus, a combined analysis of the genetic (ctDNA), transcriptomic (miRNA) and metabolomic data levels in peripheral blood samples is therefore planned in the current project to maximize their joint biomarker potential in operable breast cancer.

Sample size calculations.

The investigators performed sample size calculations using SPSS Sample Power software. These calculations demonstrated that 125 high-risk patients should be sufficient to give a log rank test power of 80%, when testing the prognostic value of ctDNA/CTC detection before surgery. The sample size calculations were based on the qualified assumption that the average 5-year survival rate in the high-risk group is 90%, whereas it is 75% and 95% in the ctDNA/CTC positive and negative subgroups, respectively. Of the estimated 125 patients, 30 were assumed positive for ctDNA/CTC and 95 negative.

B. Improve drug monitoring of tamoxifen in breast cancer

About 75% of all breast cancer belong to the luminal subtypes, which express the hormonal receptors Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor. These patients are treated with the anti estrogenic drugs; tamoxifen and/or aromatase inhibitors. The two most active tamoxifen metabolites are Z-4OHtam and Z-4OHNDtam (Z-endoxifen) have 30-100 times higher affinity for ER than tamoxifen. These metabolites ultimately constitute the blocking effect at the ER-level aiming to eradicate micro metastatic disease and are responsible for the improved survival following the establishment of this adjuvant systemic treatment. Direct measurement of these metabolites bypasses all disturbances from the diversity of CYP2D6 activity i.e. alternative metabolic pathways, adherence to the drug and inhibiting drug interactions. Our novel LC / MS-MS methodology takes into account all of the above-mentioned variables and provides a functional read-out report of the serum level of the active tamoxifen metabolites in the individual patient. This method can also distinguish between the inactive and active isomers of Endoxifen and 4-OHtam, which are the most active ER-blocking metabolites of tamoxifen. In collaboration with the Oslo Breast Cancer Research Group, the investigators have recently shown in a retrospective observational study that patients with low serum concentrations of Z-4OHtam < 3.26 nM or Z-Endoxifen < 9.00 nM (about 12% of all patients) have significant worse breast cancer specific and total survival than patients with serum concentrations above these thresholds(adjusted HR = 4.3; CI95 = 1.9-13.6) (red curves in Figure 4). Patients with a very high level of these metabolites (approximately 12% of patients) had no breast-specific endpoints Now, the investigators need to validate this discovery in independent patient materials. If validated, this will be of direct clinical benefit for 25% of ER + breast cancer patients planning adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Such therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could identify risk patients with inadequate levels of active tamoxifen metabolites. This could lead to a dose increase or switch to an alternative endocrine treatment form in these patients. Patients with very high metabolite levels can continue on tamoxifen and do not need to switch to an aromatase inhibitor.

Thus, TDM may turn out to be a paradigmatic shift in endocrine tam treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. Importantly, the distance from ""bench to bed"" in this study is very short due to our recent findings, a feasible method and over 30 years of experience with tamoxifen in the clinical setting.

C. Tumour microenvironment in breast cancer - adipose stromal immune infiltration and interaction with tumour at the growth zone

Background: Breast cancer is still the most common cancer type among women in the Western World, Norway included. Yearly, around 3500 new Norwegian breast cancer patients are diagnosed. During the last 50 years, the incidence of breast cancer in Norway has more than doubled. Interestingly, during the same time frame over-weight and obesity have increased alarmingly. Molecular subtyping of breast cancer tumours has improved the understanding of its intrinsic biology. This has opened up for a more personalized treatment approach and improved the outcome for breast cancer patients over the last 20 years .

In addition to the molecular subtyping, the diagnostics of breast cancer today consists of staging (through the TNM-classification system) and microscopic examination by a pathologist. There is increasing evidence for the prognostic value of evaluating tumour microenvironment (e.g. tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)) as a part of diagnostics in breast cancer, but as of yet this is not implemented in clinical practice. High numbers of TILs are strongly associated with good prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, but have not shown any such correlation in luminal breast cancer. Macrophages in breast adipose tissue differentiate into two distinct phenotypes, often classified as M1 and M2 with an increase of the latter in breast cancer. M1 attack and phagocytize cancer cells, while M2 have anti-inflammatory properties and have been shown to have tumour-promoting functions.

The present project will increase our knowledge of the interaction between the primary breast tumour and the immune cell infiltration in the juxta-tumoral adipose tissue. Our findings will be correlated to molecular breast cancer subtypes, proximity to tumour, markers of proliferation, and ultimately to clinical outcome The researcers reason that this knowledge will provide novel predictive targets for immune-modulating adjuvant cancer therapy. This PhD project has three interrelated work packages (WP) with the ultimate goal of identifying markers of inflammation in juxta-tumoral adipose tissue that are relevant in clinical assessment of adjuvant therapy of breast cancer. In WP 1 and 2, the phenotypical and genomic landscape of juxta-tumoral adipose tissue will be characterized, and in WP 3 the researches will investigate whether this knowledge can predict clinical outcome.

The project is based on a strong regional collaboration between the Haukeland University Hospital (HUH) and Stavanger University Hospital (SUH). For the current project, the researches have in a systematic manner collected adipose and tumour tissue from 30 consecutive breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomies at SUH. Surgical specimens of the breast are without delay forwarded to the pathologist who, under morphological control, sample relevant tissue from the invasive front and the core (0,5x1x1 cm) of the primary tumour. Controls from normal breast tissue (2000 mg) from the distant contralateral quadrant will also be collected and verified morphologically by the pathologist. The tissue is collected in duplicates pairs. One of the samples is immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for preservation, while the other half of each pair is preserved in formalin and fixated in paraffin (FFPE). In addition, three pairs of samples of adipose tissue (each of 1x1x1 cm) with increasing distance from the tumour border will make up a gradient of adipose tissue from the invasive front of the tumour area. The gradients collected are also immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and one half of each pair stored as FFPE. The researches have performed a pilot study confirming a sufficient RNA yield from the frozen tissue samples for RNA sequencing.

The tissue is collected as part of the general research biobank, Prospective Breast Cancer Biobank (PBCB) (REK# 2010/1957), an ongoing biobank-project.

The retrospective Stavanger cohort consist of all breast cancer patients diagnosed with first onset invasive breast cancer at the department of Pathology, Stavanger University Hospital, between 1993 - 2004. As SUH is the only hospital in the region this is a true population based biobank, already included are clinicopathological data like: grading, stage, TNM, treatment and proliferation markers (Ki-67, PPH3/MAI); last clinical follow-up took place in 2016.

The researches have four main hypotheses related to inflammation and immune cell infiltration in breast cancer:

The juxta-tumoral adipose tissue close to the tumour border shows an increased level of inflammation and immune cell infiltration.
The inflammation and immune cell infiltration attenuate with increased distance from the tumour border.
There are differences in the inflammation and immune cell infiltration between different subtypes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B and Basal like).
Increased inflammation and immune cell infiltration are correlated to adverse clinical outcome (i.e. relapse of disease).

4.1 STUDY DESIGN, METHODS AND ANALYSES

The researches have four main hypotheses related to inflammation and immune cell infiltration in breast cancer:

The juxta-tumoral adipose tissue close to the tumour border shows an increased level of inflammation and immune cell infiltration.
The inflammation and immune cell infiltration attenuate with increased distance from the tumour border.
There are differences in the inflammation and immune cell infiltration between different subtypes of breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B and Basal like).
Increased inflammation and immune cell infiltration are correlated to adverse clinical outcome (i.e. relapse of disease).

WP 1: MORPHOLOGIC AND GENOMIC MAPPING OF IMMUNE CELL INFILTRATION IN ADIPOSE TISSUE SURROUNDING BREAST CANCER

Background: Inflammation is an important facilitator for tumour development (16). Adipose tissue near breast cancer have been shown to have increased immune cell infiltration, but it is not yet known how this relates to molecular subtypes and/or proximity to tumour. The researches will use IHC and RNA-sequencing to evaluate the level of inflammation, infiltration of immune cells and immune gene expression signatures in the adipose tissue surrounding breast cancer.

Design: Prospective explorative study Patients, material and power calculation: Adipose tissue is collected from the prospectively collected mastectomy specimens. Tissue samples are collected from three different molecular subgroups (Luminal A, Luminal B and Basal like breast cancer), 10 in each group. Core biopsies are collected in a gradient with increasing distance from tumour border (fig. 1). The Norwegian Genomics Consortium (NGC) has confirmed that the sample sizes that are based on the selection in specific breast cancer subtypes are sufficient for statistical power.

Methods: Slides of formalin fixated tissue from tumour, invasive front and adipose tissue (fig. 1) will be stained using IHC and antibodies against immune cells (total immune cells, CD45; T cells, CD3, CD8, FoxP3; myeloid cells, CD68, HLA-DR). The slides will be evaluated by microscopy and the results will be correlated to molecular subgroups of breast cancer, localization in relation to tumour and proliferation markers (i.e. Ki67, PPH3 and MAI). In parallel, the researches will perform RNA-sequencing on frozen tissue collected from the same tissue samples as described above. Several analysis approaches will be used on the RNAseq-data. Except for analysing the data exploratory, specific analysis algorithms including deconvoluting immune cells (ABIS, CIBERSORTx) and more specifically looking at tumour immune signatures (TIP analysis), among others.

Expected outcome: The researches expect to find increased inflammation and immune cell infiltration in the juxta-tumoral adipose tissue and altered expression of inflammatory gene signatures that the researches can further investigate in WP 2.

WP 2: ASSESSMENT OF INFLAMMATORY REACTION IN JUXTA-TUMOURAL ADIPOSE TISSUE IN BREAST CANCER USING IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND IMAGING MASS CYTOMETRY.

Background: Breast cancer cells interact with the surrounding tissue and causes inflammation and immune cell infiltration in the tumour and the adipose tissue. Imaging mass cytometry has shown that immune cell infiltration in tumours correlates with prognosis, but as of yet there are no studies examining whether the adipose tissue surrounding the tumour also show structural patterns of immune cell infiltration. Therefore, the researches will examine the adipose tissue surrounding breast cancer tumours using Hyperion™ Imaging Mass Cytometry.

Design: Prospective explorative study Patients, material and power calculation: Tissue samples are collected from 30 prospectively obtained mastectomy specimens with three different molecular subgroups (Luminal A, Luminal B and Basal like breast cancer), 10 in each group. Adipose tissue is collected in a gradient away from tumour and from the contralateral quadrant as a control sample (fig. 2). A sample size of 30 patients is deemed to be sufficient for an explorative study of this sort.

Methods: A Hyperion™ IMC panel of up to 50 unique antibodies will be developed based on an already existing and validated panel available at the UoB core facility which the researches have previously successfully used in other projects. The available panel will be further extended based on findings from WP 1 and first validated on ""non-essential"" breast tissue samples before used on the above-described study samples. Using Hyperion™ IMC the researches intend to analyse the levels of inflammatory reaction in the juxta-tumoural adipose tissue. IMC data will be analysed with histoCAT+, MAV and FlowJo (typically used for flow cytometry data analysis but also highly suitable for high-parameter imaging anslysis). Furthermore, the researches will be able to use gene expression data of known and novel factors, identified in WP 1, and visualize whether the expression is generalized or compartmentalized in the adipose tissue. Normal adipose breast tissue from the contralateral quadrant will be used as control. In order to examine the influence of BC on the inflammation of juxta-tumoural adipose tissue of the various molecular subtypes in more detail, the researches also intend to stain tissue from three tissue segments extending from the tumour in order to determine whether the levels depend on the distance from tumour or the molecular subtype (Fig. 1). The inflammation in the juxta-tumoural adipose tissue will also be assessed morphologically by using IHC. This will allow us to select regions of interest to investigate using IMC.

Expected outcome: The researches expect to find increased inflammation and immune cell infiltration in the adipose tissue near the tumour and to identify novel biomarkers in the adipose tissue allowing for investigation of the clinical significance in WP 3.

WP 3: INFLAMMATORY REACTION IN JUXTA-TUMOURAL ADIPOSE TISSUE IN BREAST CANCER AND CLINICAL OUTCOME.

Background:

Immunohistochemistry is a cornerstone in breast cancer diagnostics and serves as the main modality for identifying molecular subgroups of breast cancer and proliferation markers such as Ki-67. This is essential in determining what treatment regimen is best suited for the particular patient. Heterogeneity in the tumour tissue (both tumour cells and infiltrating immune cells) have been linked to difference in clinical outcome , but it is not yet known if the same applies for the adipose tissue surrounding the tumour. Thus, the researches will examine juxta-tumoral adipose tissue for inflammation and immune cell infiltration and correlate this with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients.

Design: Clinical observational study

Patients and Methods: A number of 3500 breast cancer patients are accrued in a biobank with a median follow-up time of 15 years. A large selection of tissue samples from these patients will be assessed with respect to immune cells in the adipose tissue and biomarkers discovered in WP 1 and 2 using IHC. The samples will be stratified into three groups according to molecular subgroups (i.e. Luminal A, Luminal B and Basal like breast cancer). The tissue slides will be analysed and the results correlated with clinical outcome from the patient journals (access to journals is already approved by REK). Using Cox proportional hazard ratio and log-rank test, the researches will evaluate the effect increased inflammation in adipose tissue has on patient survivability.

Power calculation: The researches estimated the test power of the difference in recurrence free survival between patients positive and negative for juxta tumoral inflammation as assessed by IHC and IMC. The effect measure is the hazard rate (HR) as calculated by the Cox regression method. For example: 1000 patients with a recurrence rate of 15% will have created at least 150 endpoints. If the inflammation rate is 20% the researches will have an 80% power to detect a survival difference with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.80 or greater.

Expected outcome: This last work package is designed to give proof of principle that it is feasible to incorporate histological examination of juxta-tumoural adipose tissue as a part of breast cancer diagnostics. In the longer perspective the researches aim to identify new specific biomarkers of immune infiltration in adipose tissue that correlate to adverse outcome in breast cancer patients. Such biomarkers may serve as predictive tools for identifying patients eligible for adjuvant anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating treatment.

D.Monitor side effects, QoL, depression, fatigue and work life participation Background

Treatment of breast cancer employs all surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and various targeted therapy options like antiestrogen and anti HER-2 therapy.These treatment options create bothersome side effects both in a short term and long term perspective. Importantly, more complex relationships between oncological therapy modalities and subjective health complaints in breast cancer patients are recently discovered. Fatigue, anxiety and depression scores are probably functional read outs of the total treatment burden. The anti cancer treatment has also a substantial impact on Quality of Life and social aspects for the cancer survivors which extends to work life participation. Sick leave (SL) five years after the breast cancer diagnosis is more dependent on social factors than on illness (2). Hence, breast cancer hits the women twice; first the disease burden then the sosio-economic worries. Breast cancer survivors have almost 3 x higher risk of receiving disability pension (DP) compared to cancer -free patients in a retrospective register based study (3). However, this study was based on mostly abandoned oncological treatment regimens.

Aims

The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for becoming a long term SL, WAA or DP receiver by an in-depth qualitative analysis and mixed-method approach by triangulating PROM data, clinical/biological data and the NAV-data. Use of NAV-data as endpoints will provide valuable information to clinicians and general practitioners who may optimize the follow-up also in regards to work-life participation. Hence, the investigators have a robust study design to identy fisk factors for high SL, WAA and DP rates. Ultimately, the investigators aim to lower the financial expenses breast cancer generates to society.

Study design / material & methods.

The study design is an observational study where the investigators will in the present study map the rates of and denty fisk factors for high SL, WAA and DP among breast cancer survivors with the up-to date treatment schedules. The investigators will follow a 4-step translational approach:

The investigators will first conduct an exploratory qualitative study using document analysis of health and work life policy in the Norwegian context, combined with empirical data from semi- structured interviews and focus group with 20 high risk patients) to be analyzed thematically. The theoretical framework for this qualitative project is derived from symbolic interactionism in which uncovering and understanding meaning in specific contexts is a goal. Since meaningful social and professional interactions are important for psychosocial rehabilitation of breast cancer individuals symbolic interactionism is an appropriate methodological framework. This qualitative approach will create the bases of the approach in the PROM based and NAV-database oriented studies below.

NAV- data

The investigators currently collaborate with vice director Anneline Christine Teigen and senior consultant Günter Olsborg in NAV-Rogaland and the Mikrodata section at Statistics Norway (SSB). The aim for this collaboration is gain more knowledge about the use of social security services among breast cancer patients together with the NAV- Rogaland experts and together with SSB use the FD-trygd database to obtain reliable prospective sociodemographic data on SLs (both short & long term), Work Assessment Allowance (WAA) (Arbeidsavklaringspenger) and DPs (both time limited

& life long) for each patients in the present PerMoBreCan study.

Patient reported outcome measure (PROM) data is obtained at baseline and thereafter yearly from all PerMoBreCan patients. The PROM data consists of 1.HRQoL instruments (EORTC QLQ-C30,EORTC QLQ-BR23 and FACT B), 2.Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HAD, 3. Fatigue instruments Fatique Impact Scale, FIS; Fatugue Severity Scale (FSS) and VAS-fatigue, 4.Side effects questionnaires, 5. Joint- pain questionnaire, 6. The Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, MUIS; and 7. Food habits questionnaire and the 8.ROMA III questionnaire of bowel complaints (IBD and IBS).
Biomarker identification.

All patients attending this study will be screened on circulating biomarkers releated to fatigue. These biomarkers are on the protein level, genetic expression level and also on the epigenetic level. Our long-established pleasant cooperation with prof. Roald Omdal at Stavanger University Hospital, who is a clinical immuologist and transaltional fatigue researcher, is committed to conduct these analyses in his research lab.","Inclusion Criteria:

The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2013, in the USA, 226,870 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,510 women will die of breast cancer, most of them of progressive metastatic disease. Early detection and treatment of the disease, when the tumor is still localized and at a high curability state, is the outmost important determinant of disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Survival rate of women first diagnosed with pure early-stage noninvasive tumor (ductal carcinoma in situ- DCIS) is nearly 98%, which drops to 48% in patients with advanced disease.Yet, early detection of breast cancer is relatively poor. This is best exemplify by the astonishing percentage of benign biopsies; 80% of 1.7 million biopsies in the USA, at a cost of $3 billion; whereas, only small fraction (~20%) of newly diagnosed women are found to have pure DCIS.

Our preclinical studies suggest the capacity of the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent 18F-fluorobenzyl triphenyl phosphonium (FBnTP) to detects early-stage small breast tumors (e.g., DCIS), and differentiates benign from malignant masses with better accuracy than that obtained by existing breast imaging tools.

This will allow us to identify differences in the proteins produced by cells before and after radiation and between two types of breast cancers, luminal A (less likely to recur) and triple negative (more likely to recur).

First, an ultrasound scan protocol will be developed by providing patients with primary breast carcinoma with an ultrasound scan to assess the size, location, and structure of the tumor. Images in the form of B-mode ultrasound, elastography, and contrast ultrasound will be obtained, and mini-movies of the CEUS examinations will be evaluated in a post-processing step. There, individual microbubbles of the ultrasound contrast agent will be identified and tracked to reconstruct the microvasculature of the tumor lesions. Participants will each receive 2 different doses of the clinically approved ultrasound contrast agent SonoVue®. The morphological and functional parameters obtained through the post-processing with the mULM algorithm are then analyzed and subsequently validated with histological examinations. Finally, the ultrasound examination protocol will be optimized and the corresponding dosage of the ultrasound contrast agent determined.

The examination protocol established in the first section will subsequently be applied to patients with primary breast carcinoma receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography will be performed at three time points during the chemotherapy cycles and will be performed to assess tumor perfusion through application of the mULM-algorithm. The dosage of contrast agent is based on the dosage found in the previous part of the study. The CEUS examination is followed by the infusion of the chemotherapeutic agent. After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection of the tumor and microscopic examination of the tissue are performed according to guidelines.

In the final part of the study, patients with suspected breast tumor lesions are examined. They will first receive non-contrast-enhanced diagnostic ultrasound (B-mode and elastography). A contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination is performed on the largest lesion. To further develop the mULM methodology, this is performed as both 2D and 3D acquisition. The dosage of the contrast agent examination is again based on the optimal dosage found in the first study part. This ultrasound procedure is followed by guideline-guided biopsy for histologic clarification of the tumors, assessing dignity, hormone receptor as well as and HER2/neu status, proliferation rate, and vessel density.","Inclusion Criteria:

Observation period: Each patient in the study will be observed from their inclusion in the study until 1 year after the inclusion of the last patient in the study. These visits will match with the scheduled follow-up visits made by the patient according to the usual clinical practice of the site.

Determination of sample size: The calculation of the sample size will be based on determining a number of patients that will achieve the main objective of the study.

The fulfillment of the secondary objectives of the study will be obtained from the size determined by the main objective.

Main objective of the study is to: Prospectively determine the probability of conversion of the HER2 stage between the different subtypes of primary breast cancer (luminal, triple negative and HER2) and their respective metastases.

A review of the literature has allowed to find several published works with varying percentages of HER2 disagreements determined by IHQ + FISH or FISH, which have allowed to estimate an average percentage of disagreements of 10.45% (range between 4% and 20%). Considering the hypothesis that the level of disagreement in each of the different subtypes of primary, luminal, triple negative and HER2 breast cancer, is presented in an approximately similar frequency, that is to say approximately 10.45%.

From the aforementioned data, an average conversion rate to be expected of 10% will be assumed. An alpha risk of 0.05 will be accepted, with an accuracy of +/- 0.09 percentage units, with a bilateral contrast, for which it would be necessary to include 43 patients for each of the three groups mentioned above (luminal, triple negative and HER2), which consequently includes 129 patients. If a loss rate is assumed (patients registered with biopsies finally not performed or not valid, or with inconclusive results or reflecting other diagnoses) of approximately 25%, the necessary size would increase to a total of 172 patients.

The main questions the study aims to answer are:

Does the use of communication training and the use of relaxation techniques (R&R) reduce the Maximum dose to the heart (Dmax) and improve further heart dose parameters in deep inspiration during adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer?
Does R&R improve longitudinal anxiety and quality of life under patients undergoing DIBH adjuvant radiotherapy for left sided breast cancer?

However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest ""safe"" threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk.

Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain.

Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally.

Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy.

The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial randomizing R&R vs. standard-of-care management in patients with radiotherapy in DIBH for left breast cancer. The investigators primary endpoint will assess heart dose (Dmax), and secondary endpoints include longitudinal anxiety and quality of life assessment and clinic workflow efficiency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a validated patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced-technology-based cardiac dose reduction, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors.","Inclusion Criteria:

""Tailored"" means that the use of a breast density classification allocates women to a longer interval, decreasing the number of screening rounds in the 45-50-year age range. Density of the breast at the baseline is considered as an indicator of risk and also as a masking factor. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a longer interval and the reduction of side effects for women allocated to the intervention group. In this study, any further intervention is offered to high-density women who are followed-up according to the usual care interval, since the study aimed at decreasing the screening burden.

Methods 44- 45 years old women resident in the screening centre catchment area will be invited to attend for mammography screening and will be asked for informed consent in order to be included in the study. After the enrolment, they will receive a high quality digital mammography; two views and breast density will be classified according with the BI-RADS classification. Women are randomly allocated either to an usual care group or to the intervention group. In the intervention group, women with a dense breast (3-4 categories in BI-RADS) will be invited again after 1 year, while the lower-density group in the intervention arm will be invited after 2 years. After the age of 50, all women will continue to be screened in the usual service screening programme. Density of the breast will be read by 2 readers, and controversies will be solved by a consensus. Allocation of women is blinded to the mammography readers.

EXPECTED RESULTS: the outcomes are: 1. cumulative incidence of interval-cancer cases by intention to treat grouping and by density group, aimed at assessing the non inferiority of screening performance; 2. cumulative incidence of T2+/node-positive status breast cancer cases between arms and by protocol. Screening performance parameters will be evaluated at each screening round. Interim and outcome analysis are expected at 3 and 6 years average follow-up, respectively, starting from the beginning of the screening.

SAMPLE SIZE: the non-inferiority limit is derived from the accepted level of interval cancers in women 50-69 years, which was considered acceptable by the European Community Guidelines. Assuming a 70%BI-RADS 1-2 at the baseline on the basis of the digital mammography experience, the estimated sample size with a power of 90% is 16,596 women per arm.","Inclusion Criteria:

Single cell sequencing techniques have provided additional information useful in deconvolution strategies applied to model development on purified populations of immune cells. Recent interest in peripheral leukocyte subset gene expression profiles suggests that diagnostic information for many disorders may be contained therein. Mononuclear phagocytic cells including the various CD14+ subsets have been studied extensively in various disease states including some solid tumors. Previous large clinical studies at Immunis.AI have determined that transcriptomic profiles of CD14+ cell populations subtraction normalized from CD2+ cell populations were associated with aggressive disease phenotypes such as prostate cancer. Tumor heterogeneity, multifocality, and oligoclonality have been a significant barrier to development of meaningful tissue based multigene signatures for predicting cancer biologic behavior. The findings at Immunis.AI strongly suggest that analysis of RNA expression data from the body's immune surveillance cells has the potential to summarize the entire heterogeneous tumor.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved [11C]Martinostat as an investigational tracer (a type of dye used to for radiographic imaging) in a select few research studies. The FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research.

In this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called [11C]Martinostat in patients with breast cancer.

The purpose of the study is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called histone deacetylase, or 'HDAC' in breast tumors. Proteins are molecules made from amino acids that perform activities in the cell for the body to function in a healthy way. Prior research suggests that HDAC levels or amounts can be altered in some breast tumors. The investigators are trying to develop a method of imaging the HDAC protein in breast tumors. This could help them to study protein changes that occur in some breast tumors, and potentially help guide treatment of breast tumors in the future.

In this study, the investigators will take the pictures of the participant's chest, including the breasts, using a PET/MRI scanner. The investigators will the study tracer, or dye, called [11C]Martinostat to make these detailed pictures.

[11C]Martinostat was initially developed to image the HDAC protein within the brain, because amounts or levels of HDAC can be altered in some diseases of the brain. In these previous studies of [11C]Martinostat conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have been no problems).

Pre-tests will be given to the experimental and control groups in a training room at the Empowered Migrant Health Center. Data collection will take approximately 15-20 minutes. Pre-tested Syrian women will be randomly assigned to the sample pool to be divided into experimental and control groups. Romany women will be divided into experimental and control groups using the Simple Random Method.

Data Collection Tools Personal questionnaire;Introductory features questionnaire consisting of 32 questions developed by the researchers in line with the literature; It questions women's socio-demographic characteristics (age, number of children, educational status, etc.), their beliefs about early diagnosis practices, their genetic characteristics, and their status regarding early diagnosis practices for cancer. The introductory features questionnaire was translated into Arabic in a way that individuals can understand.

Health Belief Model Scale: The scale, which is used to determine the beliefs and attitudes of individuals regarding breast cancer, BSE, CBE and Mammography, was developed by Champion in 1984 and was last revised in 1999. The validity and reliability of the Arabic version of the revised Champion Health Belief Model Scale was conducted by Mikhail and Petro-Nustas. The Cronbach's Alpha value of the original scale was reported to be 0.65-0.90, and test-retest correlations of 0.40-0.68. According to the validity and reliability study of the scale for Syrian women, the number of items; sensitivity perception (5-25 points), caring perception (8-40 points), health motivation perception (6-30 points), BSE benefit perception (6-30 points), BSE perception of obstacles (7-35 points), self- efficacy perception (9-45 points), mammography barrier and benefit perception (12-60 points), and clinical breast examination barrier and benefit perception (9-45 points) sub-dimensions. The scale is in a 5-point Likert type and for each item, between 1 and 5, 1 is ""very bad""; 2 ""bad""; 3 ""medium""; 4 ""good""; 5 was rated as ""very good"". Higher scores mean that sensitivity and caring increase, health motivation for health motivation, benefits for benefit perception, barriers for obstacle perception, and self-efficacy for self-efficacy are perceived high. Scoring is reversed for items in the obstacles sub-dimension in the scale. A high total score in the scale for the sub-dimensions other than the barriers, explains that the individual's perceptions of health related to breast cancer screening behaviors are high and the rate of exhibiting the behavior will be high. Written permission was obtained from the author to use the Health Belief Model Scale.

Mammography Self-efficacy scale: The scale was developed by Champion et al in 2005. The Chronbach Alpha value is specified as 0.87 . The Arabic validity-reliability study of the scale was conducted by Al-Zalabani. The scale consists of 10 items and aims to assess women's perceived self-efficacy for mammography screening. In the Arabic evaluation of the scale, 5-point Likert-type scaling ranging from 1 to 5 ""strongly disagree"", ""disagree"", ""undecided"", ""agree"", ""strongly agree"" method was used. The total possible score ranges from 10 to 50 points, indicating a higher level of self-efficacy as the total score increases. Al-Zalabani found the Cronbach's Alpha value of the scale to be 0.88.

Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale: Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale (CMKKÖ) is an 8-item measurement tool developed by Champion. This scale determines the relationship between breast cancer and mammography behavior and women's emotional responses and is used to screen for breast cancer fear behavior. Alyami et al. In 2019, the scale was translated into Arabic and its validity and reliability study was carried out and published in 2021. The scale is five-point Likert type. Responses to the scale are scored as ""strongly disagree"" 1 point, ""disagree"" 2 points, ""undecided"" 3 points, ""agree"" 4 points, ""strongly agree"" 5 points. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 8, and the highest score is 40. A high score indicates a high fear of breast cancer. For the Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale Arabic, Cronbach's correlation coefficient is 0.94.

Breast self-exam checklist form: This checklist form was made in order to determine the practices that the individuals participating in the research knew about breast self-examination before nursing care and the behaviors they gained after nursing care.

As a result of the research, the data obtained from all tests will be evaluated and reported in the SPSS package program. Descriptive statistics, paired t test, mc nemar test and correlation analysis will be used in the evaluation of the data.

,Device: Oncotype DX breast cancer test,"a HR+, N- or pN1(mi), Her2- breast cancer adjuvant population",Other,"Primary objective:

Determine the impact of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) on the treatment recommendation made (administration of chemotherapy or not, in addition to hormonotherapy) in a HR+, N- or pN1(mi), Her2- breast cancer adjuvant population.

The impact of Oncotype DX on treatment recommendations can be either a decrease in treatment intensity defined as a change in treatment recommendation from chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone or an increase in treatment intensity defined as a movement from hormonal therapy alone to the addition of chemotherapy to hormonal therapy.

Patients with HR+, N- breast cancer currently represent around 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers. These are usually good prognosis tumors. However, on the basis of classical clinical and pathological prognostic parameters and markers, the international consensus guidelines recommend treatment with hormone- and chemotherapy in 85-95% of the cases. Considering the natural disease history, such as documented by the EBCTCG meta-analysis, more than 50% of these patients are overtreated, which leads to unnecessary side effects and costs to the health system and to the society.

Oncotype DX appears to be well adapted to therapeutic de-escalation as it targets HR+, N- patients and is performed on fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FPET). It is therefore best adapted to daily clinical practice as it does not necessitate any specific surgical procedure or tissue freezing.

The prognostic and predictive value of Oncotype DX in ER+, N- patients has been validated on three large adjuvant randomized trials (NASBP B-14, NSABP B-20, and the ATAC study). The test has been commercially available in the USA since 2004, and is being used for more than 50% of the HR+ N- patients in this country.

While Oncotype DX has been validated in the USA, it needs to be independently evaluated in France, in the context of the local treatment guidelines and habits, to provide data that are meaningful to the French health system and to the French medical community.","Treatment Decision Impact of OncotypeDX™ in HR+, N- Breast Cancer Patients",May 2012,Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Breast and axillary surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy treatments may cause upper extremity dysfunction and pain which negatively affect quality of life and daily living activities of breast cancer patients.

Lymphedema, severe pain, decreased range of motion of shoulder joint, axillary web syndrome, myofascial trigger points and myofascial adhesions are the leading causes affecting upper extremity function in patients with breast cancer.

Myofascial dysfunction presents as a problem characterized by trigger points, adhesions, and limitation of myofascial tissue and tissue gliding.

Muscle manipulation during surgery, scar tissue, soft tissue adhesions, adaptive posture development following surgery and radiotherapy induced fibrosis can cause myofascial adhesions. However, there is not sufficient research or tools for the evaluation of scar tissue and adhesions.

Detection, quantitative measurement and scoring of myofascial adhesions in upper extremity dysfunctions after breast cancer treatment are important for both developing target-oriented treatment plan and evaluation of treatment effectiveness (myofascial therapy, physical therapy modalities).

The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale is an evaluation tool utilized to detect scar tissue and was shown for reliable and valid in patients who have undergone breast cancer surgery. Its reliability and validity study for Turkish population has been done earlier.

A new diagnostic method called MAP-BC (Myofascial Adhesions in Patients after Breast Cancer) has been developed to evaluate scar tissue after breast cancer treatments and to quantitatively measure myofascial adhesions. Its reliability and validity have been proven in various countries, however, it is yet to be tested in Turkey.

The aim of this observational study is to translate the MAP-BC evaluation tool into Turkish by adapting it to Turkish society and to conduct a validity and reliability study in women who have received breast cancer treatment.

Firstly, the original version of MAP-BC will be translated into Turkish and its semantic and conceptual equivalence will be checked. Later it will be finalized by the committee consisting of two translators and four expert physiatrists.

For intra-rater reliability, the same researcher will re-evaluate patients at 14-days intervals.

For inter-rater reliability, 2 different researchers will evaluate the first 15 patients by using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale and MAP-BC tools unaware of each other's results. If the outcome of the two researchers evaluation are found in agreement at a reliable rate, then the study will be continued by a single researcher.

The convergent validity of the Turkish version of MAP-BC will be assessed by comparing the results of Turkish version of both the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale observer subscale (Patient and Observer Wound Assessment) and MAP-BC. Their correlation will be analyzed.","Inclusion Criteria:

In the long term, widespread effects such as reducing the costs women spend on breast cancer, reducing mortality and morbidity rates, raising a conscious society, training undergraduate students involved in the project, and helping them learn by experiencing the research conducted at the national level are foreseen.",The Effect of Breast Cancer Screening Training,"December 30, 2023",Anticipated,Women's Health: Neoplasm of Breast,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Neoplasm of Breast,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Parallel Assignment,Single,Screening,"Breast cancer is a disease that occurs with the uncontrolled proliferation of cells surrounding the milk glands and ducts in the breast. According to the 2020 data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Global Cancer Obsevartory (GLOBOCAN); The most common type of cancer among women worldwide is breast cancer. At the same time, breast cancer ranks second among deaths of known cause (IARCH, 2020). Similarly, according to 2019 data from the Health Statistics Yearbook, breast cancer ranks first among the most common cancer types among women in Turkey, and ranks second among deaths of known cause.

Early diagnosis in breast cancer is of great importance in increasing the survival rate and increasing the success of treatment. The fact that risk factors are effective in 20% of breast cancer cases and that most of these factors are unchangeable risk factors increases the importance of early diagnosis. Thanks to breast cancer screening methods, it is the first priority to catch breast cancer at an early stage before the clinical signs of breast cancer manifest itself and to reduce mortality rates. Early detection screenings such as Breast Self Examination (BSE), Clinical Breast Examination (CBE), and mammography are thought to be a way to increase early detection and decrease mortality rates.. According to the Turkish National Breast Cancer screening criteria, women older than 20 should periodically perform BSE every month; It is stated that women in the 20-40 age group should have CBE once every two years and women in the 40-69 age group should have CBE once a year. It is also recommended that all women between the ages of 40-69 have a mammogram every two years.

In detecting cancer at an early stage, it is extremely important to have information about the symptoms of cancer and to transform this information into behavior and observe in terms of symptoms. It is suggested that preventive behaviors such as a healthy lifestyle and health screening are beneficial methods in the prevention of breast cancer. In the literature, it has been determined that the knowledge level of women about cancer is not sufficient and they do not participate in breast cancer screening programs at the desired level and periodically.

Studies have also reported that women's attitudes towards breast cancer prevention behaviors and their level of knowledge are related to health literacy. Health literacy is extremely important for the health and health services of the general population because of its consequences that affect individuals and public health. Health literacy level, which is one of the factors that shape women's health, is effective in improving and managing women's health, and understanding and using the necessary information about women's health also increases the behavior of providing early diagnosis against diseases.. A high level of health literacy plays an important role in the protection of public health, as it constitutes an integral part of preventive health services as well as increasing the quality of life and eliminating inequalities. Considering the results of a study conducted in our country; It has been found that 68.9% of the individuals forming the society have insufficient or problematic-limited, 23.4% sufficient and 7.7% excellent health literacy level. Since individuals with low health literacy levels have difficulty in making the right decision about their health, their attitudes and behaviors towards cancer screening are more inadequate. In a study conducted in Turkey, it was concluded that women with limited health literacy had a low level of breast cancer knowledge, and that the low level of economic status and education also affected this situation. For this reason, low health literacy is considered as an important issue in terms of improving individuals' breast cancer knowledge levels and attitudes and behaviors towards screening. In a study, it was concluded that not performing BSE and not having mammography were associated with low health literacy levels. In another study, it is reported that the rate of women not having a mammogram is 52.2% and those who do not have a mammogram have a lower level of health literacy compared to women who have had a mammogram at least once.

As can be seen from the results of the study, the lack of knowledge of women on breast cancer and health literacy poses a major obstacle to people's breast cancer screening behaviors and beliefs. In order to increase social sensitivity and awareness on this issue; In particular, it is important to research, examine and examine how the municipalities and their employees, who are representatives of the society, evaluate breast cancer screening studies. From this point of view, we aimed to evaluate the effect of breast cancer screening training given to women working in the municipality on health literacy, breast cancer screening belief and behavior in our project.

With this training, awareness of women working in the municipality about breast cancer will be raised and it will be contributed to the municipalities, which are representatives of the society, to take steps to make programs that can reach a wider population. In addition, it is thought that this study will contribute to studies evaluating the effect of breast cancer screening education, which is limited in the literature, on health literacy, breast cancer screening belief and behavior.

Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death in our country and in the world. Early diagnosis in breast cancer is of great importance in increasing the survival rate and increasing the success of treatment. Studies have shown that women's knowledge about cancer is not at a sufficient level, they do not participate in breast cancer screening programs at the desired level and periodically, and their health literacy level is insufficient. The reason for this inadequacy is the lack of information. Many educational programs on breast cancer are organized. However, these programs are usually daily or weekly and are limited to increasing the level of knowledge. Breast cancer screening training cannot turn into behavior. With this study, the participants will be monitored for at least 6 months, and an effective fight against breast cancer will be taken. With the study, the knowledge and awareness of the employees working in municipalities, which are representative of the society, will be created through training and education on breast cancer screening. The results of our study will contribute to public health and to reduce health costs by preventing breast cancer with early diagnosis, with the increase in breast cancer screening rates in the long term. Nurses who play a leading role in public health and we, nurse candidates, will contribute to take steps in making programs that can reach a wider population in this regard.","Inclusion Criteria:

National medical guidelines now include the routine use of tumor profiling tests, like the Prosigna® assay, which look at the gene activity of a person's cancer cells to determine the likely outcome or course of a disease (prognosis) and predict the benefit of chemotherapy or endocrine therapy after breast surgery.

Currently, the Prosigna® assay (also called PAM-50) is FDA approved as a tool that physicians can use to help make decisions about a patient's treatment after their breast surgery. In these cases, physicians run this test using tumor tissue from a patient's breast surgery. However, the Prosigna® assay is not approved for use preoperatively, or before surgery.

Previous studies showed that the Prosigna® assay was able to identify tumor types that were more likely to benefit from treatment before surgery (whether it's hormonal therapy or chemotherapy). In this study, the investigators will use tumor tissue from the participant's biopsy to run the Prosigna® assay. The test may give both the participant and the investigators more information about the best possible treatment option for the participant before surgery.

However, there is a paucity of studies, on an individual level, to assess the role of breast fat itself in breast cancer due to lack of a non-invasive and fast measurement method. Since breast fibroglandular cells are surrounded by breast fat cells, the characteristics of breast fat may have a stronger relationship with breast cancer development, as supported by recent studies showing that a majority of breast cancer develops at the interface between fibroglandular tissue and adipose tissue. However, it is not trivial to study the role of breast fat, mainly due to the lack of a non-invasive and fast measurement method sensitive enough to important features of breast fat, such as types of fat.Recently, we have developed a rapid MRI method, referred to as Gradient-echo Spectroscopic Imaging (GSI), to measure fatty acid composition during clinical breast MRI exams. GSI can provide map of saturated fat and unsaturated fats in the breast adipose tissue without performing tissue biopsy.

The central hypotheses is that (i) the breast saturated fatty acid fraction measured by GSI is associated with the presence of malignant lesions in the breast and (ii) the breast saturated fatty acid fraction correlates positively with inflammation in the breast adipose tissue that may lead to increase in estrogen production in adipocytes.The proposed study will evaluate whether breast saturated fat is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, and whether it can provide additional diagnostic information to current clinical diagnostic exams. In addition, the proposed imaging measure of breast saturated fat can be used to assess the efficacy of any intervention to reduce cancer-related inflammation in the breast adipose tissue and to investigate the possible role of fatty acid composition in prevention and clinical management of breast cancer.","Inclusion Criteria:

Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving trastuzumab together with cyclophosphamide and vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells.

Primary

To evaluate the safety of allogeneic sargramostim (GM-CSF)-secreting breast cancer vaccine in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and cyclophosphamide in patients with high-risk or metastatic HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer.
To measure the HER2/neu-specific CD4+ T-cell response by delayed-type hypersensitivity.
To measure the magnitude of HER2/neu-specific CD8+ T-cell responses by ELISPOT.

Secondary

To assess the impact of trastuzumab on immune priming in vivo by IHC.
To measure the impact of cyclophosphamide pretreatment on CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells by flow cytometry.
To determine the time to disease progression.

Tertiary

To develop the tandem tetramer/CD107a cytotoxicity assay for HER2/neu-specific CD8+ T cells.
To measure novel T-cell responses induced by trastuzumab and cyclophosphamide-modulated vaccination.

OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes once weekly beginning on day -1 of the first course of vaccination and continuing until the completion of the last course of vaccination. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day -1 and allogeneic sargramostim (GM-CSF)-secreting breast cancer vaccine intradermally on day 0. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and the vaccine repeats every 27-42 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive a fourth course of cyclophosphamide and vaccine approximately 6-8 months after the first course.

Patients undergo delayed-type hypersensitivity testing and blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for immunologic laboratory studies. Blood samples are analyzed for serum GM-CSF levels by pharmacokinetic studies and for immune monitoring by ELISPOT and flow cytometry. Skin punch biopsies are also performed periodically and analyzed by IHC.

In women, breast cancer accounts for one in 4 cancer cases and one in 6 cancer deaths.

In Egypt, BC is the most common cancer among females accounting for 32.0% of all cancers in women according to the data of the National Cancer Registry Program of Egypt . 22038 Egyptian females breast cancer new cases were estimated to be in 2020 .

The most important risk factors for breast cancer include female gender, age (30 years old and older), positive family history for breast cancer , and familial genetic mutations, including mutations in the breast cancer A1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 genes. Furthermore, women with a history of breast cancer are more likely (20-25%) to develop microscopic cancer in the opposite breast. A positive history for cancer in the endometrium, ovaries, or colon, as well as radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, was shown to increase the risk of breast cancer.

The gold standard for diagnosis of breast cancer is histopathology. Several tumor markers have been suggested for the evaluation and management of breast cancer including estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR), which are used for the assessment of susceptibility to hormone treatment, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is used to assess the susceptibility to trastuzumab treatment.

With the rapid development of medical technology, strategies such as surgery, medication and radiotherapy can help a lot to reduce mortality rate. Though clinical intervention at early stage can greatly improve prognosis, many BC patients are asymptomatic until disease progression.

Thus, effective screening methods are in great demand for the early detection of BC. In clinical practice, many screening strategies have been widely used, such as mammography, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging.

However, these strategies are far from being perfect because of over-diagnosis, false-positive inconsistent results and potential radiation injury.

Core needle aspiration can help establish the diagnosis, but the procedure is invasive and not suitable for routine use .

Therefore, novel non-invasive screening methods of high sensitivity and specificity are needed to assist the early diagnosis of BC .

Microribonucleic Acids (microRNAs) are a large subgroup of noncoding RNAs made up of 18-25 nucleotides. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression after transcription. They have a multifunctional role, as they can perform either as oncogenes by repressing their target tumor suppressor genes, or as tumor suppressors through inhibiting the expression of their target oncogenes.

Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs played important roles in nearly all biological processes and their aberrant expression was associated with many diseases including cancers. Stable existence of miRNAs in peripheral blood circulation revealed that they could be promising noninvasive biomarkers for cancer detection.

For BC, more and more circulating miRNAs (ie, miRNA-373, miRNA-425-5p) are emerging as potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.

In breast cancer miRNA-425-5p was found elevated and predicted a poor prognosis for the patients, and its role in BC highlight a new research points for diagnostic and therapeutic plans.

MiRNA-373 Circulating level has been reported as a potential biomarker of lymph node metastasis and its expression has been linked to promoting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. It has also been reported that correlations between decreased miRNA-373 expression and BC relapse.

However, findings often differed from each other due to different experiment design, study cohorts or disease status.","Inclusion Criteria:

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Despite improvements in survival, women of low socioeconomic status (SES) diagnosed with early stage breast cancer:

Continue to experience poorer doctor-patient communication, lower satisfaction with surgery and decision making, and higher decision regret compared to women of higher SES;
Often play a passive role in decision making;
Are less likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS);
Are less likely to receive optimal care.

Those differences are disparities that predominantly affect women of low SES with early stage breast cancer, irrespective of race or ethnicity. For early stage breast cancer, low SES is a stronger predictor of poorer outcomes, treatment received and death, than race or ethnicity. The investigators define low SES as a lower income, lower educational attainment, and uninsured or state-insured status

Although BCS is the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer (stages I to IIIA), research confirms equivalent survival between mastectomy and BCS. Both options are offered yet have distinct harms and benefits, valued differently by patients. The patient and stakeholder partners involved in this study have emphasized the critical importance of supporting women in making high quality breast cancer surgery decisions (good knowledge and alignment between the patient's choice, values and priorities) irrespective of SES and health literacy. Yet, research shows that women of low SES are not usually involved in an informed, patient-centered dialogue about surgery choice. There is no evidence that women of low SES have distinct preferences that explain a lower uptake of BCS and limited engagement in decision making. Further, communication strategies are not typically adapted to women of low SES and low health literacy. Most decision aids for breast cancer have been designed for highly literate audiences, with poor accessibility and readability. Simpler, shorter decision aids delivered in the clinical encounter (encounter decision aids) may be more beneficial to underserved patients, and could reduce disparities. It is critical to determine how to effectively support women of low SES in making informed breast cancer surgery choices.

Study Aims

First, the investigators will assess the comparative effectiveness of two effective encounter decision aids (Option Grid and Picture Option Grid) against usual care on decision quality (primary outcome), shared decision making, treatment choice and other secondary outcomes across socioeconomic strata (Aim 1). Second, the investigators aim to explore the effect of the Picture Option Grid on disparities in decision making (decision quality, knowledge, and shared decision making), treatment choice, as well as mediation and moderation effects (Aim 2). Third, in order to maximize the implementation potential, the investigators will explore strategies that promote the encounter decision aids' sustained use and dissemination using a theoretical implementation model (Aim 3).

Study Description

The investigators will conduct a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority trial with stratification by SES (Aims 1 and 2) and randomization at the clinician level. One thousand, one hundred patients (half of higher SES and half of lower SES) will be recruited from five large cancer centers. In preparation for the trial (Year 01), the investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews with women of low SES who have completed treatment for early stage breast cancer to adapt the ""What Matters Most to You"" subscale of the Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) for women of low SES. Lastly, the investigators will use interviews, field-notes, and observations to explore strategies that promote the interventions' sustained use and dissemination using the Normalization Process Theory (Aim 3). Community-Based Participatory Research will be used throughout the trial (with continuous patient and stakeholder involvement).

Women 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (I to IIIA) from both higher and lower SES will be included in the trial, provided they have a basic command of English, Spanish, or Mandarin. About 367 patients will be recruited per arm.

Both interventions have been developed, tested, and shown to be effective. The Option Grid (intervention 1) is a one-page evidence-based summary of available options presented in a tabular format, listing the trade-offs that patients normally consider when making breast cancer surgery decisions. The Picture Option Grid (intervention 2) uses the same evidence and tabular layout, but it is tailored to women of lower SES and low health literacy and includes simple text and images. Because decision aids are not routinely available in real world settings, usual care is a coherent and legitimate comparator. It will include the provision of usual information resources about breast cancer but will exclude the provision of other decision aids.

Secondary outcome measures will include treatment choice, the validated 3-item CollaboRATE measure of shared decision-making (SDM), Chew's validated one-item health literacy screening question, PROMIS, an 8-item validated anxiety short form, EQ-5D-5L, a validated, standardized 6-item quality of life measure, and four items from COST, a validated financial toxicity measure. Participants will also be asked to estimate their out-of-pocket expenses over the past month. All measures will be available in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. Observer OPTION5 will be used to rate the level of shared decision making in the clinical encounter.

A regression framework (logistic regression, linear regression, mixed effect regression models, generalized estimating equations) and mediation analyses will be used in the analysis. The investigators will also use multiple informants analysis to measure and examine SES and multiple imputation to manage missing data. Heterogeneity of treatment effects analyses for SES, age, ethnicity, race, literacy, language, and study site will be performed. The investigators will also use the recordings of surgical consultations to analyze the conversations about costs and treatment recommendations made by providers.","Inclusion Criteria:

Clinical stage T1-2 N0M0 primary unilateral invasive breast cancer patients,Procedure: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB),Early breast cancer patients,,"Regional lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival in breast cancer. Accurate nodal staging can be achieved only by surgery. Today, in early-stage invasive breast cancers with clinically negative lymph nodes, minimally invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is considered the gold standard of regional lymph node staging. To optimize the effectiveness of SLNB, precise pre-and intraoperative mapping of lymphatic drainage is important. The (SLNB) technique is not standardized. The most common and most accurate way of lymphatic mapping is performed with the combined application of a gamma-emitting isotope labeled substance and blue dye, the so-called double labeling technique. Functional lymphatic drainage of SLNB double staining in the mammary gland, skin and axilla present a number of uncertainties.

According to the axillary, lateral thoracic and thoracodorsal veins, Ibusuki et al. divided the axillary region into four subregions: brachial (lateral), pectoral (anterior), central and subscapular (posterior) zones. They revealed clear relationship between the anatomic location and status of the SLN, also confirmed by Gallowitsch et al. SLN was detected in Level I in 96% and in Level II in 4% by SPECT/CT.

Knowedge of relationships between the drainage of sentinel lymph node staining into the axillary subregions, location of the primary tumor, tumor size, SLN positivity and its location within the subregion are of particular importance in the decision making whether or not axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) needs to be performed.

In the prospective randomized phase 3 trial by Giuliano et al. (ACOSOG Z-11) ALND was not performed in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative axilla and breast-conserving surgery, for 1-2 macroscopically positive SLNs (10). After an average follow-up of 6.3 years, data were compared to the traditional ALND group and no difference was detected in 5-year overall survival or disease-free survival at 5 years.

Aims of the investigation:

To examine the location of SLN in the axillary subregion (anterior, posterior, central, lateral, apical) in patients with early breast cancer (T <5 cm).

To statistically assess correlations between the location, size, histological parameters of primary breast tumor and the subregion of the SLN.

To statistically assess SLN positivity and its location within the sbregion.

To statistically assess subregional localisation of positive SLN and the number of all positive regional lymph nodes, to predict a limited number of cases with lymph node metastasis, based on the test results of the ACOSOG Z-11 trial, by which ALND could be omitted.",Functional Anatomical Examination of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Drainage in the Axillary Subregions in Early Breast Cancer,February 2015,Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Giving letrozole before surgery allows us to monitor the effects of letrozole on the tumor on a molecular level and determine markers of response to treatment.

Primary To determine that in breast tumors that continue to exhibit high proliferation (i.e., Ki67) upon hormone deprivation (with letrozole), their gene expression and/or a mutational or proteomic signatures will harbor molecules or 'pathways' that are biomarkers of resistance to endocrine therapy or a cause of it.

The ultimate goal of these aims is to identify clinically-targetable pathways which can be exploited to enhance responses and survival in patients with ER+ breast cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily for 7-21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 24 hours after the last dose of letrozole, patients undergo total mastectomy or segmental resection with lymph node evaluation.

Pre-treatment diagnostic breast tissue is obtained. Patients undergo treatment and then undergo standard of care mastectomy or lumpectomy. Pre and post treatment tumor tissue samples are analyzed for Ki67, P-ER, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and caspase 3 by immunohistochemistry; and RNA microarray.","DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

It is well documented that tumor growth requires specific conditions for its development from the occurrence of a mutation to a clinically detectable cancer. It has been shown that living peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have different ability of cytosolic enzymes (esterases) to convert hydrophobic substrate fluorescein diacetate (FDA) into hydrophilic fluorescent fluorescein. It depends on PBMC cycle stage, size, surface state, physiological states, such as activation and apoptosis.

The important step of breast cancer genesis is the early change of functional activity of cytosolic enzymes (esterases) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such transformations in PBMC may be detected accurately by an existing device Flowcytometer (FACS™ MultiSET™ System, company ""Becton Dickinson"" GmbH, USA), where measurements of fluorescence polarization and enzymatic hydrolysis of FDA substrate are recorded. A conclusion about presentation of breast cancer among examined women is achieved by ""CDT"" (cancer detection technology) software, which analyzes mathematically the results of fluorescence polarization and enzymatic hydrolysis.

Moreover, the combined biochemical model together with additional prognostic parameters (such as age, ethnic group, gynecological and obstetric anamnesis) increases the validity (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) of the diagnostic conclusion.

These are not cancer, but may mean that a woman is more likely to develop breast cancer in the future. This study explores how atypia develop into breast cancer in terms of number of women, time to cancer development, cancer type and severity, and whether this varies for different types of atypia. The results will be used to create new guidelines for how women with atypia should be followed up.",Breast Screening Atypia and Subsequent Development of Cancer in England,"December 30, 2023",Anticipated,Breast Cancer,,,BC04,Neoplasms,,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,low,,,,,,"In England, breast cancer screening is offered every three years to women aged 50 to 70. In an increasing number of women atypical epithelial proliferations (atypias) are detected. Atypias are a heterogeneous group of abnormalities, which are not cancer but carry a low but significant rate of associated malignancy. Detecting these lesions has uncertain benefit because of insufficient evidence on their risk of subsequent development into breast cancer. This information is key to optimising follow-up and subsequent screening. This study undertakes the first analysis of the Sloane atypia data by reporting the proportion of women with atypia who develop breast cancer by type of atypia (atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) or atypical intraductal epithelial proliferation (AIDEP), flat epithelial atypia (FEA), and lobular in situ neoplasia (LISN: atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)) and in what time frame.

This large-scale study of atypia uses the English screening programme data from the Sloane cohort study. The Sloane atypia project is a prospective cohort of atypia diagnosed through the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme from April 2003 to the present. For this analysis, English screening units are included with radiology, histopathology, surgery and radiotherapy proformas. Subsequent development of breast cancer has been identified by matching women by NHS number and date of birth to the English Cancer Registry held by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). The atypia cases are also matched to the Mortality and Birth Information System to collect mortality data for censoring follow-up, and the Breast Screening Data Repository for information on invitation and attendance at subsequent screening mammography appointments.

Study objectives are:

To characterise atypia in terms of type, method of investigation and women's demographics;
To determine breast cancer risk over time by type of atypia;
To characterise the nature of subsequent cancers detected, and their prognostic features;
To communicate results to clinicians and women;

The incidence and mortality rates for female breast cancer far exceeded those for other cancers . Although the incidence rate of breast cancer has risen, the mortality rates have steadily fallen due to early diagnosis and better treatments . Early detection of breast cancer often leads to better outcomes. According to Cancer Australia's National Cancer Control Indicators, the relative survival for females diagnosed with early-stage breast cancers at diagnosis was much higher than that for those with advanced breast diagnosis.

Despite the improvement in diagnosis and treatment,approximately 20% of BC patients will develop metastasis.This setting is considered an incurable disease that often occurs due to either resistance to therapy or diagnosis at advanced stages . In this scenario, although 44% of the patients are diagnosed at stage I (AJCC cancer staging) with 5-year survival rates of 100%, 5% of patients are diagnosed at stage IV with 5-year survival rates of approximately 26% .

The small percentage of women diagnosed at advanced stage of the disease gives evidence that mammography represents the best available screening option for breast cancer .

However, more accurate and meaningful early-diagnosis methods together with image techniques would improve BC survival rates.

MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are short endogenous noncoding RNA molecules of 19-25 nt that have important gene regulatory roles at post-transcriptional level [8, 9]. They pair with messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of protein-coding genes and depending on complementarity, leading to mRNa translational repression or degradation . They regulate 30% of transcripts and contain 3% of the human genome .

In the past few years, miRNAs were established as relevant molecular components of cells in normal or malignant processes.. Particularly, miRNAs have been demonstrated to have an important role in cancer biology through post transcriptional editing of target messenger RNAs expression involved in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis or immune escape .

In addition, several tumor-associated miRNA profiles have been proposed and investigated as biomarkers for diagnosis, survival, response to treatment or tumor subclassification.

The development of early diagnostic tools is of most interest to the clinics since early diagnosis is associated with better prognosis.

In this context, miRNAs have been demonstrated to be good early diagnostic biomarkers in several types of cancer including BC, among others.

One of the main advantages of circulating miRNAs is their high stability in body fluids , which is the main reason for them to be used in cancer diagnosis or prognosis.

Moreover, the assessment of circulating miRNAs can be carried out with simple, lowcost and quick assays.

These characteristics highlight the value of miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers. Indeed, several miRNAs have been found to be differentially expressed in blood, plasma or serum from healthy donors compared with BC patients, supporting their use as noninvasive, early-stage diagnosis biomarkers.

Growing evidences revealed that imaging techniques are associated with some limitations such as expensive. Hence, it seems that utilization of improvement imaging techniques and biochemistry biomarkers could overcome the limitations associated with imaging techniques. Beside utilization of imaging techniques, identification of new biomarkers in patients with breast cancer has provided an interesting landscape .

So studies have identified different circulating miRNAs as new biomarkers for BC detection; Moreover, they have not been assessed in conjunction with diagnostic imaging, which is used for quantifying the extent of the disease and provides information related to tumour aggressiveness representing an obligatory step for treatment planning. The use of diagnostic imaging to extract quantitative parameters related to the morphology, metabolism and functionality of tumours, as well as to correlate specific imaging parameters with molecular biomarkers, is an emerging research topic","Inclusion Criteria:

Lymph node negative breast cancer,Radiation: Dose-integrated accelerated EBRT in pN0 breast cancer,Accelerated dose-integrated radiotherapy - pN0,Experimental,"Adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer improves local control, also in the elderly. Hormonal therapy in hormone sensitive tumors improves results but can not substitute radiotherapy. Improved local control leads to less breast cancer related morbidity and mortality, also in an older population (Schonberg, JCO, 2011).

Unfortunately, in older patients with lower life expectancy, adjuvant radiotherapy is often omitted. Following reasons are invoked:

frailty of the patient
fear for toxicity
impaired mobility, rendering transportation and positioning more difficult
dependency for transportation to and from the radiotherapy departement
negative cost effectiveness ratio, due to high cost (especially for complex techniques and long schedules) and lower benefit (lower life expectancy)

Hypofractionation is feasible without increased toxicity, and combines better local control with patient comfort and lower costs. Further lowering the number of fractions (from 15-21 to 5) will further improve patient comfort, but is challenging when different doses are needed in the same target volume. This problem is addressed using advanced techniques permitting dose-integration.

In the elder with cancer, several unrecognized geriatric problems, including depression and cognitive impairment, can be detected by CGA . Some problems do interact with cancer treatment. In this study screening and assessment is provided to support patients and to develop an inventory of radiotherapy obstacles.

Our study includes breast cancer patients, ≥70 years old, referred for adjuvant radiotherapy after surgical treatment. A schedule of 5 fractions is offered, encompassing different targets of treatment.",Highly Accelerated Dose-Integrated Radiotherapy in 5 Fractions in Breast Cancer,"July 13, 2018",Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,"Adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer improves local control and overall survival, also in the elderly. Hormonal therapy in hormone sensitive tumors improves results but can not substitute radiotherapy (EBCTCG, Lancet, 2011). Improved local control, leads to less breast cancer related morbidity and mortality, also in an older population (Schonberg, JCO, 2011).

Unfortunately, in older patients with lower life expectancy, adjuvant radiotherapy is often perceived as too cumbersome. As a consequence, patients who could have benefit from breast conserving therapy are referred for mastectomy. Even when breast-conserving surgery is chosen, adjuvant radiotherapy is sometimes omitted in frail patients over 70 years fearing the burden of daily transportation to the radiation department. However, omitting radiotherapy results in a higher risk of loco-regional recurrence. It has been shown that older patients have a worse prognosis due to suboptimal treatment, especially in locally advanced breast cancer (Schonberg, JCO, 2011).

Following reasons are invoked by the patients or the care-givers:

frailty of the patient
fear for (mostly acute) toxicity
impaired mobility, rendering transportation and positioning more difficult
dependency on third parties (family, services) for transportation to and from the radiotherapy departement
negative cost effectiveness ratio, due to high cost (especially for complex techniques and long schedules) and lower benefit (lower life expectancy)

Hypofractionation and acceleration are proven to be feasible in recent trials (cf. Start Trial, Fast Trial).

Based on these data and in order to overcome above mentioned obstacles for radiotherapy in breast cancer, we start a study with accelerated radiotherapy in women above 70 years old.

As we are experienced in advanced techniques as IMRT, VMAT, simultaneous dose-integration and IGRT, we will use simultaneous dose integrated protocols to permit inclusion of early as well as locally advanced breast cancer.

Integration of doses within one global volume encompasses several advantages:

number of fractions can be maintained, regardless of the indication
imprevisible high doses due to overlap of adjacent fields in tangential techniques is avoided
high dose volume is more adequately limited to the actual region of high risk, as dose difference is smaller.

In order to evaluate the impact of accelerated radiotherapy on the well being of the patient and on the treatment cost, quality of life (QoL) will be measured and a cost-analysis will be performed.

Methodology of research At the radiotherapy intake consultation, patients with age ≥70 years are extensively informed on the advantages and the possible risks of accelerated irradiation. A written documentation of the study is provided to permit consultation of family and general practitioner before consent for participation. Until 1 week before the start of radiotherapy, patients can decide wether or not to participate in this study without impact on the starting day. Inclusion is performed after signing the informed consent.

The aim is to include 70 patients aged ≥ 70 years, who, after signing the informed consent, will be treated with the accelerated schemes over 10 days (5 sessions, every other day). Following doses are prescribed

Breast: 5x5,7Gy
R0 boost: 5x6.5Gy
R1 boost: 5x6.9Gy
Thoracic wall: 5x5.7Gy
Lymph nodes: 5x5.4Gy --> these doses are simultaneously integrated, and regions are prescribed according to our standard protocol .

Positioning of the patient depends on technical possibilities and patient rigidity:

for breast irradiation without lymph nodes, prone positioning is preferred if feasible, if not the patient is positioned in supine
for thoracic irradiation with or without lymph node irradiation, patient is always installed in supine position
for breast + lymph node irradiation, patients are installed in supine position.

End points of our study are acute and chronic toxicity, loco-regional control and QoL.

The study is divided in two different strata (first group without lymph node irradiation, second group with lymph node irradiation) for following reasons:

these groups represent different outcomes with lymph node invasion having a negative impact on morbidity, loco-regional control and overall survival
a higher frequency of acute moist desquamation might occur in the second group (lymph nodes included) as compared to the first group, due to a larger target volume.
the brachial plexus is a special concern, as it lies close or even within the target volume. Therefore we will monitor closely the effects on the brachial plexus for the second group. Nevertheless, as the total dose is lower than with normo-fractionation, the risk for brachial neuropathy is maximally reduced.

Groups

40 patients in group 1: irradiation of breast/thoracic wall with or without integrated boost without lymph node irradiation
30 patients in group 2: irradiation of breast/thoracic wall with or without integrated boost and with lymph node region irradiation

An application for funding to perform geriatric assessment is introduced. In the elder with cancer, several unrecognized geriatric problems, including depression and cognitive impairment, can be detected bij CGA . Some of these problems even interact with cancer treatment. In this study screening and assessment is provided to develop an inventory of obstacles for undergoing radiotherapy.

When screening scores positive (G8 score ≤ 14/17) geriatric assessment will be performed to evaluate the problems and needs of the patient. Patients will be referred for appropriate treatment and support. As described by Schönberg, treatment in early stage breast cancer might even lead to improved morbidity and mortality when compared to a non-cancer population, due to the 'healthy user' effect, detecting otherwise unrevealed problems. In the scope of this study, this effect can not be evaluated.

Power analysis To estimate the number of patients needed, we applied the Wilson score confidence interval test for binomial proportion, which is a 2-sided exact method for power analysis, using ""SAS Power and Sample Size"".

In the year 2005, the American Cancer Society has estimated that 212,240 new invasive cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed, and predicts 40,410 deaths will result from breast cancer. While 80% of patients present with locoregional disease involving the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes, about half develop disseminated disease and ultimately die from it. Stage IV breast cancer is typically managed with hormonal agents or conventional cytotoxic drugs. Tumors quickly become resistant to these treatments. Immunotherapy is a particularly attractive strategy for overcoming drug resistance and can be integrated with existing therapeutic modalities in an additive or synergistic fashion. Immunotherapy is a type of treatment for cancer based on the idea that the immune system can be activated to destroy cancer cells that might be resistant to hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. A vaccine is a kind of immunotherapy that delivers an antigen (something that activates the immune system) so that the immune system recognizes cells with that antigen as foreign and destroys any cells that display that antigen.

The allogeneic breast tumor cell vaccine consists of two types of breast tumor cells developed from the tumor cells of patients with breast cancer. The human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene was used to genetically modify the breast tumor cells to secrete GM-CSF. GM-CSF is a substance made by the body that helps the immune system recognize a tumor and destroy it. The vaccine cells were irradiated to prevent them from growing or dividing. The cells themselves are not radioactive. The cells are stored frozen until the day of vaccination. The total number of cells in each vaccine will be 500,000,000, divided into twelve injections given in the thighs and arms. The choice of twelve injections for each vaccine is based on the volume of the vaccine and a finding that the body has a better chance to respond to the vaccine if it is injected into a number of different areas.

We propose to test the safety and bioactivity of an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine when given in a specifically timed sequence with Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab, two drugs commonly used to treat breast cancer. In this study the Cyclophosphamide is used at lower doses than usual to help the vaccine to activate the patient's immune system. Trastuzumab will be given at doses that are commonly used to treat breast cancer and it may also increase the immune response. The dose and scheduling of Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab used are based on testing the drugs with a GM-CSF-secreting vaccine in mice that get breast cancer, and are the ones that enabled the vaccine to induce the most potent anti-tumor immunity. The dose of vaccine cells is based on the safety of the same dose of a similar GM-CSF-secreting vaccine for pancreatic cancer. This breast cancer vaccine has also been given to people with breast cancer by itself, and with Cyclophosphamide and another chemotherapy drug, Doxorubicin. To date, people have had no vaccine-related serious side effects, but not enough people have received the vaccine to know if it treats breast cancer. The vaccine is experimental and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the FDA has permitted its use in this research study. This is the second study of this breast cancer vaccine and the first study to test this vaccine with Trastuzumab.

The main purposes of this study are to test the safety, clinical benefit, and bioactivity of vaccine therapy in combination with Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing Stage IV breast cancer. This study will also to test whether the Cyclophosphamide can eliminate the suppressive influence of regulatory T cells, and whether Trastuzumab can increase antigen processing and presentation. These drug activities may make the immune system react better and enhance the effects of the vaccine in treating breast cancer.

The study is open to men and women with HER-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Concurrent hormone therapy and/or bisphosphonates (standard breast cancer therapy that is not chemotherapy or other investigational therapy) is allowed. Patients may have received Trastuzumab in the past or continue on it while participating in this study. About 40 people with HER-2/neu positive breast cancer will enter in the study. About 20 will pass the screening tests and receive the vaccine.

Research subjects will receive a fixed dose of the allogeneic breast tumor vaccine consisting of two irradiated allogeneic breast cancer cell lines transfected with the GM-CSF gene in a specifically timed sequence with a low dose of Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab. Patients will receive 300 mg/m2 of Cyclophosphamide on day -1, and the vaccine on day 0. Weekly Trastuzumab will be timed to coincide with Cyclophosphamide administration. Research subjects will receive three monthly vaccination cycles, with a fourth and final (boost) vaccination cycle three months from the third cycle.

Blood samples to measure GM-CSF levels will be taken on the day of vaccination, every day for 4 days, and then on day 7 after vaccination. Blood samples to evaluate the safety of the vaccinations will be taken about once a week for one month following each vaccination. During studies of the breast vaccine and similar vaccines in renal cell cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, local symptoms of swelling and redness developed at the vaccine site between 2 and 7 days after vaccination. In this study, if the subject's vaccination site shows swelling over 1 cm in diameter, a skin biopsy will be taken. The skin biopsy will be evaluated to determine to what types of cells are important to the immune response. Based on our previous preclinical and clinical data, the biopsy will be taken on day 3, and possibly on day 7, after the first and third vaccinations. Other tests and evaluations include history and physical examination, vital signs, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, nuclear medicine bone scan, pre-vaccination biopsy, blood for immune monitoring, and a skin test for delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) that is like a purified protein derivative (PPD) test and involves injecting pieces of a protein antigen (HER-2/neu) that is delivered by the breast cancer vaccine. The purpose of the DTH test is to evaluate whether the research subject has developed a systemic immune response to the breast cancer vaccine. Tumor core needle biopsies will be obtained at baseline, and on days 0 and +14 of vaccine cycle 1 only.

Patients will be evaluated clinically and with laboratory testing for evidence of disease progression after each cycle or when otherwise clinically indicated. Computed tomography (CT scan) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and nuclear medicine bone scan will also be performed to evaluate disease status prior to starting the study, after vaccine cycle 3 and prior to and after vaccine cycle 4. About every three months cardiac function will be evaluated.","Inclusion Criteria:

"Single arm divided in three cohorts, each cohort with a different type of metastatic disease: estrogen receptor (ER) + breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and endometrial cancer",Drug: ONC201,Arm 1-ONC201 in Recurrent/Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer and Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma,Experimental,"Background:

The new drug ONC201 have been shown to kill breast cancer and endometrial cancer cells in the laboratory. The exact mechanism of action is not completely clear yet, but the ONC201 destroys the mitochondria inside the cells. Blocking mitochondrial activity may kill tumor cells, which would shrink tumors. Researchers want to see if ONC201 helps shrink tumors of certain breast or endometrial cancers and if that effect is maintained.

Objective:

To see if ONC201 shrinks tumors with a lasting effect.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older who have metastatic breast cancer (hormone-positive or triple-negative) or metastatic endometrial cancers.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history
Physical exam
Heart, blood, and urine tests
Computed tomography (CT) and bone scans
Review of medical report and tumor sample
Participants will have a tumor biopsy before starting treatment and after 5 weeks taking the study drug. A scan or ultrasound may be used to guide the biopsy. Patients will receive local anesthetic and a needle will remove a small piece of tumor.
The study will be done in 28-day cycles. Every day 1 of each cycle participants will repeat most screening tests, will be seen by the physician and receive a supply of the study drug.
Participants will take the study drug by mouth once every 7 days. They will keep a diary of when they take the drug and any side effects. During cycle 1, participants will get weekly calls to discuss their health and symptoms. Images will be repeated every 2 cycles to evaluate response to the treatment.",ONC201 in Recurrent/Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer and Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma,"October 7, 2021",Actual,Triple Negative Breast Cancer,D000009369,Neoplasms,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,"Background:

Advanced breast cancer and endometrial cancer have limited treatment options. Current treatments provide a modest improvement in progression free survival, but no treatments improve survival.
ONC201 is the founding member of a novel class of anticancer drugs called imipridones. The exact mechanism of ONC201 is unknown at this time, but preclinical data suggests that it causes global downregulation of mitochondrial genes leading to mitochondrial damage and ultimately non-apoptotic cell death.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that ONC201 selectively kills various cancer cells, including breast cancer cells (hormone-receptor positive cell lines, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) cell line as well as triple negative breast cancer cell lines) and endometrial cancer cells, while having little effect on normal cells.
An on-going phase I study of ONC201 has demonstrated clinical benefit in some solid tumors, including endometrial cancer.

Objectives:

Cohort 1: To determine the progression free survival (PFS) at 8 months of ONC201 in metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer (HR+BC)
Cohort 2: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of ONC201 in metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
Cohort 3: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of ONC201 in advanced endometrial cancer (EC)

hypofractionated IMRT for right sided breast cancer,Radiation: intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for breast cancer,1-Hypofractionated IMRT,Active Comparator,"Several multicenter studies have shown the equivalence of hypofractionated radiotherapy and normofractionated radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. However, the treatment in these studies was carried out with conventional techniques and not with the modern IMRT. Also the evaluation of quality of life and cosmetic outcome were not standardized.

This study is a two-arm prospective study comparing normofractionated and hypofractionated radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer using tangential IMRT techniques.

The primary endpoints are acute and chronic cosmetic breast changes. The secondary endpoint is the patients' quality of life.

Patients to be included are breast cancer 60 years old patients or older with tumour stages pTis-pT3, pN0-pN1a, M0 after breast-conserving surgery. Patients with right sided breast cancer are stratified to receive a hypofractionated treatment course (40.05 / 2.67Gy in 15 fractions) and the left sided breast cancer a normofractionated irradiation (50/2Gy in 25 fractions). In both arms, patients between 60-69 years are to receive a boost (16 Gy / 2Gy).

In both groups, a tangential intensity-modulated radiation technique aiming to achieve optimal dose homogeneity is applied.

Since higher single radiation dose to the heart can lead to higher morbidity and/or mortality, patient stratification according to the diseased side was adopted where the left-sided breast cancer patients would receive normofractionated 2Gy single dose. Therefore there is no randomization.

For classification and grading of adverse cosmetic events, the ""Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC-AE V3.0) and the recognized LENT-SOMA scores are to be regularly documented. Quality of life is to be documented with two standardized, validated questionnaires ""QLQ C30 and BR23"" of the EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer). The questionnaires are to be filled by the patients themselves at different time points during the study period.

A sum of grade III fibrosis, grade III telangiectasia and grade II hyperpigmentation of around 20% is expected after 2 years.

Therefore, calculation of the required number of cases based on an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% with a maximal tolerable toxicity difference of 15% within 2 years results in the need for recruiting 226 patients (113 in each arm) (non-inferiority of hypofractionated therapy).",Comparison of the Cosmetic Outcome of Hypofractionated Versus Normofractionated IMRT in Treatment of Breast Cancer,"February 2, 2017",Actual,Tumors,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Parallel Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The immediate reconstruction surgery is called an immediate autologous reconstruction (IR) and is different than the standard reconstruction surgery people with T4 breast cancer have. IR is a surgical procedure where immediately following your mastectomy, the surgeon takes tissue from another part of your body and uses it to re-create your breast. The standard reconstruction surgery occurs later and can be done with an implant or tissue from your body.

Based on the location of the tumor, a decision will be made as to the best approach to obtain these cells.

DENDRITIC CELL COLLECTION: Participants will undergo a procedure known as leukapheresis to obtain their dendritic cells (this procedure may be done before or after the tumor cells have been obtained). This procedure takes about 2-4 hours. If not enough cells are collected, the participant may be asked to return for an additional leukapheresis procedure. If sufficient number of cells are obtained, tumor cells and dendritic cells will then be fused (combined together to make one larger cell) together in the laboratory and divided into the appropriate dose for administration.

TREATMENT: Treatment will consist of an injection of tumor cells fused with dendritic cells under the skin every 3 weeks for a total of 9 weeks. The dose that the participant receives will depend on the total number of fusion cells that are made.

Experimental chemotherapy using neoadjuvant approach,Drug: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy,1,Experimental,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathological CR rate in breast and lymph nodes of a novel neoadjuvant regimen for invasive breast carcinoma.,Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Breast Cancer,December 2012,Anticipated,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used for years to treat patients with breast cancer whose primary tumors are too large to allow for breast conservation surgery [1]. Reduction in size of the primary tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has made possible the use of lumpectomies instead of mastectomies in a large fraction of these cases. In the past this was the major objective of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, but more recently the focus has changed and the goals have expanded [2]to include: 1- determination of the chemosensitivity of the tumor so that subsequent chemotherapy can be modified accordingly. 2- to prolong disease free survival . 3- to prolong survival.

So far there has been no consistent improvement in survival using this approach, although two recent studies suggest that a survival benefit might actually occur[3, 4]. However, there is consensus that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who achieve a ""pathological CR"", meaning that no tumor is found at time of definitive tumor resection, have experienced longer survival[5-8]. Perhaps with a more active neoadjuvant combination a significantly higher pathological CR rate can be obtained, and thus longer survival achieved.

Most neoadjuvant regimens that have been used in the past have only included induction with 3-4 courses of an anthracycline based regimen without a Taxane, followed by surgery and further chemotherapy subsequently. However, the incorporation of docetaxel after an anthracycline-based regimen (Aberdeen and NSABP-B27 protocols) [4, 9]led to better clinical response, subsequently to better breast conservation and more important, an increase in the pathological complete response rate. In the NSABP-B-27 study, 2,411 patients with operable primary breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: a) four cycles of preoperative AC followed by surgery. b) four cycles of preoperative AC followed by four cycles of preoperative docetaxel (100 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks), or c) four cycles of AC followed by surgery and subsequently four cycles of postoperative docetaxel. Compared to preoperative AC alone, preoperative AC followed by preoperative docetaxel increased the clinical complete response rate (40.1% v 63.6%; P < .001), the overall clinical response rate (85.5% v 90.7%; P < .001), the pathologic complete response rate (13.7% v 26.1%; P < .001), and the proportion of patients with negative nodes (50.8% v 58.2%; P < .001).

Improvement of relapse free survival has also been observed in the NSABP-B-27 and Aberdeen trials. In the latter trial, improvement in overall survival has also been reported.. A statistically significant improvement in overall survival has not been observed yet in the NSABP-B-27 trial but a longer follow-up of this study is required to better evaluate the impact of including Taxotere (Docetaxel) as part of the neoadjuvant strategy on overall survival of breast cancer. One subgroup of patients in the NSABP-B-27 trial was found in a retrospective analysis to benefit the most. This was the group who achieved a clinical partial response after the first four courses of AC and who received four additional courses of Docetaxel. They benefited from a longer disease free survival.

In another neoadjuvant trial performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center, patients with a pathologic response but with residual tumors >1 cm were randomized to receive postoperative chemotherapy based on their response to preoperative chemotherapy. Those patients who had a change in their chemotherapy experienced a longer survival.

A review of neoadjuvant trials shows that those with the higher number of preop chemotherapy courses have the best results. We feel that the next step should be the development of a preoperative combination chemotherapeutic regimen which provides the highest pathological complete response rate and the highest lymph node negative status.

In our study we propose to: 1- incorporate Docetaxel as part of the induction neoadjuvant regimen in all patients. 2- tailor the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen according to the preoperative response as judged by MRI so that patients whose maximum response after the first four courses of an anthracycline-docetaxel based combination, is a partial remission or less, will receive four courses of a non-cross resistant regimen. 3- prolong the duration of neoadjuvant preoperative chemotherapy to a total of eight courses. 4- complete the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery so that the chances for a pathological CR are increased. 5- include Trastuzumab (Herceptin) as part of the neoadjuvant treatment in patients who are Her-2 positive.

A combination derived from the established TAC (Taxotere, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide) regimen but which uses Epirubicin, a less cardiotoxic analogue of Doxorubicin (Adriamycin), will be tested. Those Her-2 negative patients whose response to the first 4 courses of induction TEC is less than a complete remission, will have their treatment changed to a second line regimen, Navelbine-Avastin-Xeloda (""NAX""), with the intention of capturing a better response prior to surgery. Those who are Her-2 positive will initially also receive TEC but subsequent therapy will include Trastuzumab (Herceptin) whether they respond well or not to TEC.","Inclusion Criteria:

Patients who plan to receive or have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible. Patients undergo examination for breast and axilla lymph adenopathy and then undergo ultrasound of the axillary nodes prior to registration to confirm eligibility and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Within 12 weeks of completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo a mastectomy or lumpectomy (per surgeon discretion) including both sentinel lymph node surgery and axillary lymph node dissection. The primary and secondary objectives of the study are described below.

Primary Objective:

1. To determine the false negative rate for sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery. Among the patients who have at least one sentinel lymph node identified and removed, false negative rate is defined as the number of patients declared to have no evidence of cancer in the SLN and are found to have at least one positive lymph node in the ALND divided by the total number of patients with at least one positive axillary lymph node by ALND.

Secondary Objectives:

To determine how the axillary ultrasound status of the patient upon completion of preoperative chemotherapy (evidence of residual lymphadenopathy on the ultrasound examination versus no evidence of lymphadenopathy in the ultrasound examination) affects the false negative rate of SLN and how sonographic findings correlate with residual disease on final pathology.
To determine the node status of patients after preoperative chemotherapy. Patients will be classified as node positive if they were determined to have at least one positive lymph node by SLN or ALND. Patients will be classified as node negative if all nodes examined by SLN and ALND were negative.
To determine whether the false-negative rate for SLN surgery after preoperative chemotherapy is related to the extent of residual cancer burden (RCB) overall, or separately in the breast or regional nodal basin.
To evaluate pathological complete response (pCR) rates (defined as no invasive disease in breast or lymph nodes) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in node-positive patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy.

After completion of surgery, patients will visit the office for follow-up exams at 1-2 weeks then patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, yearly for 2 years, then every other year for 6 years. The study closed to accrual and treatment on 5/29/12.","Eligibility Criteria:

Primary

Determine if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can induce complete tumor necrosis in women with invasive breast cancer.

Secondary

Determine whether breast MRI can accurately predict residual cancer and tumor necrosis in patients treated with RFA.
Determine the toxicity of RFA in these patients.
Determine the cosmetic outcome after RFA in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized study.

Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using gadopentetate dimeglumine. Within the next few days, patients undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) over approximately 20-30 minutes. Patients then undergo a second DCE-MRI 3 to 21 days after RFA, followed by definitive surgery (standard mastectomy or lumpectomy).

Pathologic confirmation of the post-ablation DCE-MRI findings is performed within 1 to 21 days after the second MRI. Tumor cell viability and proliferative activity are assessed by immunohistochemical and biomarker analysis.","Inclusion Criteria:

Diagnosis of invasive breast cancer - the following information must be known based on the needle core biopsy: tumor grade, hormone receptor status, and HER2/neu status. Patients with a previous history of either ipsilateral or contralateral excisional biopsy are not excluded. However, patients are excluded if an excisional biopsy was used to diagnose the current breast cancer.

Note: Subjects undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy will not be excluded from this research study. It is not expected that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) will interfere with the SLN procedure because other studies have demonstrated the accuracy of sentinel node staging after excisional biopsy. The axillary staging in these subjects will be noted.

Tumor size < 2 centimeters by mammogram or ultrasound, with ultrasound being the preferred method of evaluation. Measurements by physical exam should also be recorded. If mammogram and ultrasound are discordant, then the imaging modality that determines the largest tumor size will be used to determine eligibility.
Ultrasound measurements: Distance from tumor to skin must be > 1 cm; distance from tumor to chest wall must be > 1 cm. The RFA procedure, which burns the tumor, may also burn the skin or muscle if it is too close (< 1cm).
Laboratory values within 2 weeks of registration: platelet count ≥ 50,000; INR ≤ 1.6; serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 ml/min/m^2
Age 18 years or older
Women must not be pregnant due to MR scanning of pregnant women is not FDA approved. All females of childbearing potential must have a urine study within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out. Breast feeding must be discontinued prior to study entry.

Exclusion Criteria:

Subjects for whom neo-adjuvant therapy is planned will be excluded from this study
Patients with history of severe asthma and/or allergies will be excluded to avoid potential adverse reactions to the MRI contrast agent (Gd-DTPA)

DBT from GE offer synthetic two-dimensional DM generated from the DBT data (SM), and studies have shown similar detection rates for this technique as of adjacent DM. By comparing results of early performance measures and economic aspects in two comparable populations of women in the same age group, residing in the same county, the investigators can measure the effect of SM+DBT versus standard DM with equipment from GE Healthcare. The populations will be examined by the same radiographers, screen-read by the same radiologists, histologically breast cancer proven by the same pathologists, and treated by the same surgeons and oncologists.

A prospective cohort study targeting 45,000 women invited to breast cancer screening in Bergen, Hordaland in the study period, 2016-2018, will be performed. A screening participation of approximately 75% is expected. All attending women will be asked if they are willing to participate in the study after receiving written and oral information about the study. Women willing to participate in the study will sign an informed consent. Of the attending women it is expected that about 90-95% will consent to participate in the study. The women will be randomized into two groups, a study group and a control group. The randomization will take place at the screening unit in Bergen. The outcome of the randomization is based on the 11-digit personal identification number assigned to every citizen in Norway. In the study group, the women will be screened with SM+DBT. In the control group, the women will be screened with DM. Women not willing to participate in the study will be screened with DM, and not included in our study.

The study of the lymphocytes TCR and BCR diversity could permit to better understand how lymphopenia act on overall survival and to improve detection of high risk patients who could benefit of adapted therapies for better care.,Prognostic Value of Divpenia and CD4 Count in Relapsed Breast or Lung Cancer Patients,December 2014,Actual,Breast Cancer,D000012142,Respiratory Tract Neoplasms,BC04,Neoplasms,Lung Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,low,D000008175,Lung Neoplasms,,,,"The therapeutic management recommendations of patients with metastatic cancer offer standard treatment in specific situations. But, there is always a subgroup of patients who do not benefit from treatment and which has a very low survival. The risk of death for patients is very variable depending on the initial cancer site, tumor aggressiveness and chemosensitivity of tumours.

It's therefore important to have relevant prognostic tools to predict such an excess of relative toxicity or drug resistance. Simple prognostic factors for survival as the performance status (PS) have already been highlighted in several studies. Thus, the possibility to identify a group of patients with a higher risk of mortality could be of major interest for clinicians. In fact such stratification will allow:

To limit this risk by adjusting the therapy and/or associated treatments (antibiotic prophylaxis, dose reduction ...),
To develop protocols for testing innovative strategies specific to this high risk population.

The objectives of these innovative protocols would be designed to correct lymphodivpenia.

The main objective is to show that T divpenia (low TCR combinatorial diversity <30%) is a risk factor for early death after chemotherapy (early death: any death occurring within 3 months (lung cancer) or within 6 months (breast cancer) after the start of chemotherapy).

The secondary objectives are:

To establish that the divpenia factor is independent of clinical and biological prognostic factors (PS, LDH, haemoglobin, lymphopenia or ANC) to predict a early death,
To establish that the prognostic score NDL which will combine in a two-dimensional graph the CD4 count or total lymphocytes count and TCR repertoire diversity will allow a better stratification of lympho-divpenic patients who will benefit from more appropriate treatments,
To characterize other circulating markers this could improve the identification of the early death risk (phenotypic markers, cytokines ...) in combination with the previous settings.

Prognostic models have been established in many tumor types at the initial stage or at time of the relapse (breast and lung cancers ...). It seems necessary to highlight other clinical and biological prognostic factors that would estimate a lower survival at 6 months, whatever the nature or the original site of the tumour.

The strong prognostic value of lymphopenia in the early death after chemotherapy or hematologic toxicity of chemotherapy has recently been established in several tumor models. 25% of patients with metastatic solid cancers have a systemic immune dysfunction.

Further analysis incorporating prior any treatment (D0) a systematic phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations in the patients' blood showed that a significant reduction in the absolute number of peripheral CD4+ T cells (<450/μl) was an independent factor risk of early death and febrile neutropenia in patients with solid cancers of different origin (lymphoma, myeloma, sarcoma, breast cancer) treated with chemotherapy.

However, early death remains rare events and a more recent study has established that a lymphopenia (<1000 lymphocytes/µl) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with solid tumours.

Recent studies have shown the importance of combinatorial diversity of T and B lymphocytes repertoire (TCR/BCR) in the efficiency of the immune response against infection.

A preliminary analysis of TCR repertoire diversity, in a retrospective cohort of patients with metastatic breast cancer, demonstrated the independent predictive value of divpenia for overall survival in these patients. This research has demonstrated that patients with cancer had a very large disparity in immune TCR diversity and that it was not always correlated with lymphocyte count.

These preliminary data show that the discriminating power of TCR diversity is greater than the measurement of cell count. The combined analysis of these data in a NDL® graph may help to better discriminate patients at risk for which it is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies.","Inclusion Criteria:

Primary

To determine the in situ antitumor effect of neoadjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride as measured by a reduction in Ki67 and/or an increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive tumor cells in patients with treatment-naive, operable breast cancer.

Secondary

To identify a molecular profile, based on measurements of Estrogen Receptor (ER), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), and a Human Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor-2(HER2), and protein expression profiles in patients with treatment-naïve, operable breast cancer that is responsive to erlotinib hydrochloride.
To correlate tumor concentrations of erlotinib hydrochloride with serum levels immediately before surgery.

OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for 5-14 days. Patients then undergo surgical resection within 24 hours after the last dose of erlotinib hydrochloride.

Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and during surgery for correlative laboratory studies. Tissue samples are stained for ER, HER2, and EGFR levels, proliferation (Ki67), and apoptosis (TUNEL) by immunohistochemistry. Levels of erlotinib hydrochloride in tissue samples are measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Blood samples are collected on the day of surgery. Levels of erlotinib hydrochloride in blood samples are measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

Patients are followed within 6 weeks after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria:

A longer time is necessary to give them again explanation, to reassure and to listen to them. However, patients are not always in ability to hear due to their psychological status. Young women seem to be more in distress, this is linked to the fear of the disease, the change of their social status and the future of their children.

It must be noted that there is an increase of complementary therapies including Touch-Massage. Studies showed its interest on quality of life, anxiety, pain and fatigue.

The concept Touch-massage (TM) is defined as a benevolent concern that takes shape through the touch and the sequence of gesture on all or parts of the body. This allows to calm, to relax, to get back into shape, to reassure, to communicate or simply to provide well-being, enjoyable to receive and to practice.

"Patients in this arm will receive 400mg of celecoxib once daily. In addition, Hormone Receptor (+) patients will receive endocrine treatment according to local practice.",Drug: Celecoxib,Celecoxib,Experimental,"It has been found that the chemical changes that take place in a patient's body during the development of inflammation may provide an environment which stimulates cancer cells. One step in the development of inflammation is the production of certain chemical substances which are important in the formation and spread of tumours. These are called prostaglandins. Cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) is an enzyme (a substance that speeds up chemical changes in the body) involved in the production of these prostaglandins and although it is not usually present in most tissues it is made at the sites of inflammation. Celecoxib is a selective Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) which works by blocking the action of the COX-2 enzyme, leading to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins and a reduction in inflammation.

The purpose of this study is therefore to find out if celecoxib can be used after breast cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy) to reduce inflammation and thus reduce the ability of new tumours to grow and survive.

2590 women with primary breast cancer will be recruited in this study from several locations in the United Kingdom and Germany. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated a treatment group, which can be celecoxib or placebo. Both treatments are taken orally (celecoxib 400mg daily, placebo 2 tablets daily) for a total of 2 years. In addition, hormone receptor positive patients will receive endocrine treatment as per local practice.

The inflammatory process may provide an environment for development of malignant disease, with mediators of inflammatory response such as the cyclo-oxygenases playing an important role and providing a target for therapeutic intervention.

Prostaglandins (PGs) are synthesised from phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A2 and cyclo-oxygenases. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) -1 differs from COX-2 in that the latter is inducible and its expression is induced by a large range of oncogenes and growth factors. Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that does not cause the effects of COX-1 inhibition, namely gastrointestinal ulceration.

The key regulatory step in this process is the enzymatic conversion of fatty acids to PGG2 and PGH2 by COX. PGH2 is subsequently converted to one of several structurally related PGs including PGE2, PGD2, PGF2, and thromboxane A2 (TxA2), by the activity of specific PG synthases. PGs have important functions in every organ system and regulate a variety of physiological functions such as immunity, maintenance of vascular integrity and bone metabolism. COX-2 is not normally expressed in most tissues, but is induced by a wide spectrum of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines in specific pathophysiological conditions. The expression of COX-2 is highly induced in cells transformed with the oncogene v-src or treated with phorbol esters.

Several studies have suggested an association between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption and decreased breast cancer risk.

Elevated COX expression in breast cancer was suggested some time ago by the finding of elevated PG production in breast tumours.

There is pharmacological and genetic evidence to indicate that a significant component of the anticancer property of NSAIDs is due to their ability to inhibit the COX-2 enzyme.

This phase III randomised study assesses the impact on disease free survival and overall survival of the Cox-2 inhibitor Celecoxib as maintenance therapy following surgery and chemotherapy in the treatment of primary breast cancer.

2590 women with primary breast cancer will be recruited in this study from several locations in the United Kingdom and Germany.

Prior to randomization all patients should have completed at least 4 cycles of (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who satisfy all the eligibility criteria for the study will be informed and consented to join the study.

inflammatory breast cancer cases,,inflammatory breast cancer cases,,"Background:

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, poorly understood and particularly aggressive form of breast cancer.
Three characteristics of IBC tumors their rapid progression, their extensive formation of new blood vessels, and the fact that these characteristics are present from the inception of the tumor make it an ideal model for studying factors associated with tumor aggressiveness.
This study is a collaboration among several institutions in the United States and North Africa that have extensive epidemiological experience and experience with IBC.

Objectives:

- To understand what causes certain types of breast conditions, including IBC.

Eligibility:

- Women 18 years of age and older with IBC and non-IBC and healthy women volunteers are eligible. Women who have had a previous diagnosis of any kind of breast cancer are excluded.

Design:

Participants complete a questionnaire providing information about their background, including medical and reproductive history, family health history and lifestyle habits and undergo the following additional procedures:
Height, weight, hip and chest measurements.
Saliva sample collection to measure biological factors that may be related to breast conditions.
Breast examination and, if permission is given, photographs of affected breast.

Two control groups will be included: 1) 400 non-IBC breast cancer cases and; 2) 400 visitor controls (excluding those with breast, ovarian, endometrial, and nasopharyngeal cancers) in the study hospitals. The study will involve the administration of a questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and saliva collection for all study subjects. In addition, digital photographs of the breasts will be collected for IBC cases, and a clinical examination form and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue will be collected for IBC cases and non-IOBC breast cancer controls.

Therefore, the integrin αvβ3 receptor is becoming a valuable target for diagnosis and response evaluation of malignant tumors.

The tri-peptide sequence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) can specifically bind to the integrin αvβ3 receptor. Accordingly, a variety of radiolabeled RGD-based peptides have been developed for non-invasive imaging of integrin αvβ3 expression via single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)or positron emission tomography (PET). Among all the RGD radiotracers studied, several RGD monomers have been investigated in clinical trials, and the preliminary results demonstrated specific imaging of various types of tumors, and the tumor uptake correlated well with the level of integrin αvβ3 expression. Recently, several RGD dimeric peptides with PEG linkers have been studied. The new types of RGD peptides showed much higher in vitro integrin αvβ3-binding affinity than the single RGD tri-peptide sequence, and importantly, they exhibited significantly increased tumor uptake and improved in vivo kinetics in animal models. As a representative, 99mTc-3PRGD2 could be easily prepared and exhibited excellent in vivo behaviors in animal models. No adverse reactions are observed in animal models to date.

In the general population, sleep disturbance and insomnia cause significant health problems and impact on the quality of life of many individuals. The incidence of insomnia in cancer patients is disproportionality higher, with breast cancer patients experiencing prevalence rates ranging from 19% to 69%. The impact of insomnia on cancer patients' lives can be significant and is associated with depression, cancer-related fatigue, increased pain, reduced quality of life, decreased immunity, disease progression, and survival. To date, breast cancer studies show large variation in reported insomnia prevalence rates, and the severity of sleep complaints in these patients have been difficult to assess. Thus, these issues require further investigation using standardised and validated measures.

The world's highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus is found in Egypt. Several investigators examined the epidemiological association of HCV with breast cancer. Published literature reports conflicting results regarding the HCV association with breast cancer incidence. Population-based studies from HCV-endemic area demonstrated increased breast cancer incidence in HCV-positive women younger than 50 years. On the other hand, population studies from HCV-low prevalence regions failed to detect an association of the virus with breast cancer.

HCV seropositive patients constitute a large sector of oncology patients treated in Egyptian practice. HCV infection with or without clinically-significant liver disease impose several therapeutic, social and logistic problems. Recently, investigators from Mansoura University reported their findings among breast cancerpatients. According to these data, HCV-positive breast cancer patients had several markers of disease aggression such as large tumor size, high tumor grade and nodal infiltration. Moreover, HCV-NS4 (non-structural protein-4) blood levels positively correlated with the level of the known breast cancer marker CA15-3.

In the current study, the investigators will investigate the incidence of HCV seropositivity in breast cancer patients and an age-matched control group. The study also examines the association of HCV status on the patients' baseline characteristics such as tumor stage and grade and with patients' treatment plan and treatment outcome.

Specifically, the aims of the study are the following:

To test if HCV seropositivity is associated with breast cancer diagnosis in Egyptian population.
To test if HCV-positive patients harbour more aggressive breast tumors.
To test if HCV-positivity affects management decision in breast cancer patients.
To test if HCV-positive patients suffer more frequent adverse effects to breast cancer treatment.

Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving chemotherapy together with everolimus before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether cisplatin and paclitaxel are more effective when given together with or without everolimus in treating patients with breast cancer.

To determine treatment-mediated changes in cell cycle position, proliferation, and apoptosis as well as status, levels, and phosphorylation state of S6K, p53, p73, and p63 and select p53 family target genes before and after initiation of paclitaxel.
To isolate RNA and generate microarray data sets from pre- and post-treatment biopsy material to identify a pre-treatment gene signature that will predict response.
To isolate RNA and generate microarray data sets from pre- and post-treatment biopsy material to identify a change in gene signature after the first treatment that will predict response.
To isolate RNA and generate microarray data sets from pre- and post-treatment biopsy material to determine if previously established p63 and p73 gene signatures predict response to treatment.
To isolate RNA and generate microarray data sets from pre- and post-treatment biopsy material to determine if a change will be observed in p63 and p73 gene signatures between pre- and post-treatment biopsies.
To isolate RNA and generate microarray data sets from pre- and post-treatment biopsy material to determine if triple-negative breast cancers can be clustered into different subtypes on the basis of gene expression, given the size of the microarray data set that will be generated from this clinical trial and previous clinical trials (> 100 tumors).
To isolate RNA and generate microarray data sets from pre- and post-treatment biopsy material to determine if p63 and p73 gene signatures can sub-classify triple-negative breast cancers.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to initial lymph node status (positive vs negative involvement) and tumor grade (low or intermediate vs high). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and oral everolimus once weekly in weeks 1-12 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 4-12 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and oral placebo once weekly in weeks 1-12 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 4-12 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Approximately 3-6 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo partial or total mastectomy with lymph node evaluation. Patients may then receive additional chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Patients undergo ultrasound-guided core biopsies at baseline and in weeks 1, 4, and 12 for analysis of proliferation, apoptosis, and pathway activity markers via IHC or western blotting and RNA microarrays.

Patients are followed up within 3 weeks after surgery.","Eligibility criteria

Between 1990-2009, based on data from Contract Health Service Delivery Area Counties across the US, the mortality-to-incidence ratios for these cancers were significantly higher for American Indian/Alaska Natives compared to Whites (breast: 1.22, colorectal: 1.16, cervix: 1.36), indicating poorer survival. New Mexico (NM) AIs also experience substantial cancer disparities. Between 2010-2014, AIs compared to Whites had higher incidence (per 100,000) for cervical (7.9 vs. 6.9) and colorectal (male: 46.5 vs. 35.2; female: 29.2 vs. 28.2) cancers, and higher mortality for cervical (3.7 vs. 1.3) and colorectal (males only; 18.9 vs. 15.6) cancers. AIs were more likely to receive a late-stage (i.e., regional or distant) cancer diagnosis for all 3 screen detectable cancers. AIs have some of the lowest cancer screening rates compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In NM, AIs listed in the Indian Health Service (IHS) Albuquerque Area have substantially lower screening rates than the state's White population do. AIs had screening rates of: breast (58.5%, women ages 52-64), colorectal (41.9%, ages 50-75), and cervical (63.9%, women ages 24-64) cancers; whereas, screening rates for Whites were: breast (70.0%, ages 50-74), colorectal (69.2%, ages 50-75), and cervical (77.8%, women 21-65).

The Community Prevention Services Task Force's Guide to Community Preventive Services (""The Community Guide"") recommends evidence-based strategies for multicomponent interventions to promote breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening. Multicomponent interventions combine approaches to enhance community demand for and access to, and provider delivery of screening services. Evidence suggests that interventions that combine approaches from the 3 strategies or that combine approaches to increase community demand and access result in the largest increases in screening rates.

The overall objective is to develop and pilot test culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions to enhance age- and risk-appropriate breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening in concordance with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended guidelines. The aims are to:

Aim 1. Continue to foster a sustainable multi-directional, participatory collaboration (""community collaborative"" through a Tribal Advisory Panel (TAP)) between the Zuni's tribal leadership, stakeholders, Zuni Indian Health Service Comprehensive Health Center, and UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC) researchers to enhance community-engaged cancer control training, education, and research.

Aim 2. Using participatory approaches by engaging the TAP, finalize multilevel/multicomponent intervention strategies to increase provider delivery of, community access to, and community demand for screening for the screen-detectable cancers.

Aim 3. Pilot test (using a stepped-wedge trial design and qualitative methods) the multilevel/multicomponent culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention strategies on outcomes such as: impact on screening practices; feasibility of implementation and acceptability of the intervention; and cost effectiveness of the intervention.

Aim 4. Disseminate findings appropriately tailored to the needs of targeted non-scientific and scientific audiences (i.e., TAP, tribal leaders, Zuni community, Zuni IHS healthcare providers; annual NM Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence symposium and national conference attendees, and peer-reviewed publications).

Protocol A. Aim 1-Foster a Community Collaborative (TAP) Procedure-Fostering the Community Collaborative: The 9-member community collaborative, Tribal Advisory Panel, represents the Zuni tribal leadership, Zuni stakeholders and local organizations (i.e., Health and Wellness program directors, Community Health Representatives [CHRs], cancer survivors), healthcare providers (i.e., Zuni IHS Comprehensive Health Center, hereafter ""health center""), and UNMCCC researchers. The TAP ensures active community engagement and a non-hierarchical partnership model. The TAP brings expertise in tribal health priorities and policies, cultural and linguistic sensitivities, development and delivery of intervention, education and training needs for students and CHRs, and delivery of healthcare services. The TAP will meet quarterly, or more often if necessitated.

B. Aim 2-Finalize the Multilevel/Multicomponent Intervention Strategies Procedure-Finalization of Intervention Strategies: To finalize the intervention, the investigators will: (a) map data collected through on-going research with The Community Guide's recommendations of evidence-based strategies to enhance cancer screening; (b) develop small media for the 3 screen-detectable cancers.

B1. Data mapping and participatory engagement of the TAP: The investigators will map and present data, along with evidence-based recommendations from The Community Guide, to the TAP for participatory input on appropriate multilevel/multicomponent intervention strategies that can enhance screening. These data were collected through prior research and consist of environmental scans of resources available to offer screening services, and structural/system-level promoters and barriers to providing screening and qualitative and quantitative assessments of cancer related knowledge, attitudes, screening practices, and screening barriers in the Zuni Pueblo.

The overall focus of the intervention model, per The Community Guide, is on intervention strategies that fall into 3 categories. First, increase community access by reducing structural/systemic barriers (e.g., reduce administrative barriers, patient navigation, assist in appointment scheduling, set up alternative screening sites, and modify screening clinic hours). Second, increase community demand using culturally, linguistically, and health literacy appropriate group education, 1-on-1 education, client reminders and incentives, mass media, and small media (i.e., educational brochures). Third, increase provider delivery of screening services through, improved provider recommendations, provider reminder/recall systems, and shared-decision making tools. Evidence suggests that a combination of strategies from each category leads to greater effects. The investigators will conjointly work with the TAP to select evidence-based intervention strategies (at least 1 strategy from at least 2 [preferably all 3] categories) that can best address barriers identified through the qualitative and quantitative research, can leverage existing resources at the health center, and meet the cancer control needs of the Zuni people.

B2. Develop small media: The investigators will develop small media (i.e., educational brochure) on the 3 cancers. The Community Guide recommended strategies to increase demand for and access to screening require the ability to understand cancer risk, screening benefits, health system navigation-all to make informed decisions and take appropriate action. The investigators will use small media to convey this information. The investigators will operationalize the Multi-level Health Outcomes Framework (MHOF) constructs such as knowledge, susceptibility, severity, norms, and self-efficacy in the small media, and document health literacy using the Suitability Assessment of Materials and Comprehensibility of Materials (SAM+CAM) instrument.

Research Design: Qualitative design, using focus group methodology
Study Population: Zuni men age 50-75 years and Zuni women age 21-75 years
Recruitment Target: about 30-36 eligible persons (assuming attrition)
Recruitment Methods: Purposive sampling methods
Procedures: Conduct three focus groups, with each group consisting of 6 to 8 participants. Each session will meet for approximately two hours. Before starting the discussion, participants will provide informed consent and complete a survey collecting socio-demographic information. The purpose of these focus groups is to finalize the intervention's educational materials, ensuring they are culturally appropriate and contain messages operationalizing various constructs of the theory guiding the study (MHOF).
Data Analysis: Each team member will read the transcripts independently and create individual summaries in accordance with each domain area. The investigators will then meet as a group to review the summaries and through a process of comparing/contrasting observations, the investigators will distill the input into a series of recommendations from which the investigators will modify the 3 brochures. Following the creation of subsequent versions of the brochures, the investigators will then send them to participants from the 3 groups for further review and comments.
Sample Size Considerations: While the number of focus groups cannot be precisely determined prior to data collection, based on prior experience, 3 groups should be sufficient to capture the full range of salient themes.

C. Aim 3: Pilot Test the Multilevel/Multicomponent Intervention C1. Quantitative Research (Pilot Test Effectiveness of the Intervention [INT])

Research Design: Cluster randomized stepped-wedge
Research Setting: Zuni Pueblo
Clusters and Randomization: The investigators will form 4 cluster categories stratified by gender and age. In all, the investigators will form 12 clusters, each comprising 10 participants. The cluster categories, number of clusters per category, and cancer-specific INTs that the clusters will receive are as follows. (1) 5 clusters of men aged 50-75 (for colorectal cancer INT). (2) 3 clusters of women aged 50-75 (for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer INTs). (3) 2 clusters of women aged 50-75 (for breast and colorectal cancer INTs). (4) 2 clusters of women aged 21-49 (for cervical cancer INT). The investigators will randomize each cluster and offer the cluster category specific cancer INT(s).
Participant Identification and Sampling: The investigators will use a combination of community meetings, posters, health fairs, and announcements on Zuni Radio to inform the Pueblo residents of the study. The investigators will maintain a list by contact information, gender, and age of those who are willing to participate in the study. The investigators will select all members of a household eligible for any of the 3 cancer-specific INTs.
Interventions: Educational and behavioral interventions on cancers of the breast, colorectal, and cervix (breast cancer screening intervention; colorectal cancer screening intervention; and cervical cancer screening intervention).
Procedures: The investigators will contact (in-person) interested participants just prior to their cluster being randomized to the INT condition and provide them with a recruitment packet. The packet will contain materials describing the study, PI contact information, description of the overall benefits and risks of participation, consent letter for the surveys, and date for the first study activity (i.e., baseline survey and first INT session). The packet will also contain a card with a unique identifier that links the participants to the surveys and INT. The card will also contain a scheduling calendar to inform participants about the date and time for the next project activity (survey, INT session, focus group). Zuni students and CHRs will administer the surveys. The investigators will conduct 3 waves of outcomes evaluation surveys: baseline, posttest #1, and posttest #2. The investigators will administer all surveys in-person and each will last approximately 20 minutes. Prior to each project activity, the investigators will contact (phone or in-person) participants informing them of the date, time and place of the upcoming activity. During each project activity, the investigators will confirm/update the participants' contact information. Between posttest #1, and posttest #2, the investigators will remind (phone or in-person; at 3-monthly intervals), if necessary, participants to complete their screening exam.
Implementation of the Intervention [INT]: The TAP will finalize the INT strategies (Aim 2). The overall INT will be bounded by contextual realities (rurality of the Zuni Pueblo, resources at the health center, budget for the project). With this context in mind, the investigators could operationalize The Community Guide's recommended strategies that the TAP may plausibly identify as follows: To increase community access, the investigators could: (a) Identify a point-person (i.e., Public Health Nurse) at the health center who will triage participants to and schedule them for appropriate screening(s). (b) Remind (phone or in-person) participants (between posttest #1, and posttest #2) to complete their screening exam(s), offer assistance in scheduling a screening appointment and a ride to the health center. These strategies would reduce administrative barriers, navigate participants, and assist with transportation and in scheduling an appointment. To increase community demand, the investigators could consider: (a) Small media. (b) 1-on-1 education (supplemented by the small media) by the project's CHRs. (c) Reminders between posttest #1, and posttest #2. (d) Cognitive-behavioral group education and incentives. To increase provider delivery, the investigators could: (a) Reduce health center-specific systemic barriers by identifying a point-person to promote and facilitate screening services.
Baseline and Posttest Surveys: The investigators will collect data on demographics, knowledge, attitudes, perceived control, perceived susceptibility and severity, social support, self-efficacy, and patient activation. At posttest #1, and posttest #2, the investigators will inquire with whom and with how many persons they discussed the intervention.
Primary Outcome: Uptake of any combination of FOBT/FIT, Pap smear, or mammogram screening.
Secondary Outcome: Temporal changes on MHOF constructs and their predictive value on screening; feasibility and acceptability (described below); cost-effectiveness (described below); and promoters/barriers to screening (described below).

i. Primary outcome: Completion of cancer screening. The investigators will compare the number of cancer screening approaches undertaken by study participants, offset by the number of possible screening tests, using Poisson regression approaches between those who are and are not receiving active intervention. This will enable the estimation and comparison of screening uptake between treatment arms, even when there are different numbers of possible screening tests for groups of participants. The investigators will account for within-cluster correlations using generalized estimating equations, and the investigators will explore the impact on screening uptake of patient characteristics (e.g. sex) using fixed effects.

ii. Secondary outcomes. I. Feasibility/acceptability: The investigators will summarize the various measures feasibility with descriptive statistics. The investigators will use count and percentages for most measures, but for others, such as measures of study promotion, the investigators will summarize the efforts undertaken using means and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate for the data type.

II. Promoters/barriers to screening: Analysis discussed under implementation of qualitative data collection (Aim 3).

III. Positive changes in MHOF constructs: The investigators will also compare changes in MHOF constructs (knowledge, attitudes, beliefs), perceived control, self-efficacy, and patient activation, using linear mixed effects approaches that simultaneously account for within-person and within-cluster correlations.

IV. Cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis: The investigators will utilize a Markov decision analytical model to simulate the progression of our cohorts (across the 3 cancers: breast, colorectal, and cervical) through predefined states: normal, local, regional, disseminated, and death. The likelihood of progressing through states (or remaining within states) will be derived from the literature. All 3 cancer-specific INTs will be compared to a no-screen pathway. The difference between each INT-based pathway and its respective no-screen pathway is a function of the change in the probability of detection across each state of cancer progression. The analysis compares the costs and outcomes over a predetermined timeframe (likely to be longer (20+ years) for breast and cervical and shorter for colorectal (10-20 years)). Costs and benefits will be discounted. Our main CE outcome measures will be years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per YLS). Additional CE outcome measures will include: the number of new cases and deaths from cancer, the number of new screenings, and potential deaths from new screenings (colonoscopy).

l. Sample Size Considerations: The investigators will enroll 10 participants into 12 different clusters, for a total of 120 participants. With this number of participants, and assuming that those not in the active intervention group have historical screening uptake levels (a weighted average of roughly 50%), then the study will have at least 80% power to detect a relative increase in screening uptake of 20%, using a two-sided type I error level of 5%, as long as the intra-cluster correlation is no larger than 0.62. As this degree of intra-cluster correlation is very large, the study is well positioned to detect meaningful intervention effects on screening uptake.

C2. Qualitative Research (Understand Behavior Change Context)

Research Design: Qualitative design, using focus group methodology
Study Population: Zuni men age 50-75 years and Zuni women age 21-75 years. Those who completed at least 1 screening exam and those who did not complete any exam (Section C2).
Recruitment Target: about 30-36 eligible persons (assuming attrition)
Recruitment Methods: Purposive sampling methods
Procedures: Conduct three focus groups, with each group consisting of 6 to 8 participants. Each session will meet for approximately two hours. Before starting the discussion, participants will provide informed consent and complete a survey collecting socio-demographic information. The purpose of these focus groups is to finalize the intervention's educational materials, ensuring they are culturally appropriate and contain messages operationalizing various constructs of the theory guiding the study (MHOF).
Data Analysis: Each team member will read the transcripts independently and create individual summaries in accordance with each domain area. The investigators will then meet as a group to review the summaries and through a process of comparing/contrasting observations, the investigators will distill the input into a series of recommendations from which the investigators will modify the 3 brochures. Following the creation of subsequent versions of the brochures, the investigators will then send them to participants from the 3 groups for further review and comments.
Sample Size Considerations: While the number of focus groups cannot be precisely determined prior to data collection, based on prior experience, 3 groups should be sufficient to capture the full range of salient themes.

C3. Assessment of Feasibility and Acceptability C3a. Procedure: The investigators will analyze project records to quantify each feasibility measure. (1) Accrual (completion of targeted enrollment): Number of eligible participants enrolled. (2) Attrition rate (<20%): Numerator=Number of enrollees who completed the baseline survey but subsequently dropped-out of the study at various intervals (i.e., before, during, or after completing INT, or before either of posttest #1, and posttest #2assessments). Denominator=Total number of enrollees. (3) Study promotion: Number of flyers distributed, nature and number of inquiries received, and sources of such inquiries. (4) Fidelity of INT implementation (per protocol): The investigators will define the implementation protocols to document fidelity after the TAP finalizes the overall INT.

C4. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis C4a. Procedure: The investigators will collect and use primary and secondary data to define parameters for the Markov models of cost-effectiveness (CE). Primary data used for determining the CE of the intervention will include: compliance improvements, costs related to the intervention (at both the patient (indirect) and provider (direct) levels), age- and gender-stratified participation rates, and cancer detection rates of the study population. Secondary data used for determining the CE of the intervention will include: NM-specific cancer incidence, staging, and mortality rates, and direct medical costs related to both the screening (primary costs) and treatment/management (secondary costs) of screen-positive participants. Our data will allow estimates of screening uptake, cancer incidence, cancer staging, treatment costs, and cancer mortality across the 3 cancer screening interventions. The investigators will collect data on all direct medical costs associated with the INT and follow-up, and indirect medical and non-medical costs (e.g., work loss, travel, etc.) when possible. The investigators will assess direct medical costs through the IHS Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), which contains patient encounter-level data by outpatient International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 diagnoses and procedure codes. The investigators will collect cancer diagnostic, treatment and inpatient data through hospital discharge abstracts included in IHS contract billing. The investigators will use a micro-costing approach to assess the cost of resources used or median cost of encounter based on a resource-based relative value unit (RBRVU) system. The RBRVU is Medicare's reimbursement rate for outpatient visits based on the procedure codes recorded for the encounter and is used to estimate the healthcare system cost of procedures performed. Our main outcome measures will be years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per YLS). Secondary outcome measures will include: the number of new cases and deaths from cancer, the number of screenings, and potential deaths from screenings (colonoscopy).

D. Aim 4-Dissemination D1. Procedure: The investigators will disseminate findings tailored to targeted non-scientific and scientific audiences. The investigators present preliminary results on an annual basis to the Zuni Tribal leadership. The investigators will also present findings to the Tribal Advisory Panel, general community, health center providers, and the IHS health board. The TAP will assist in these dissemination efforts. After approval from the tribal leadership, the investigators will publish the study findings.","Inclusion Criteria: Breast Cancer Screening Intervention

Patients will be operated by breast conservative surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. Each patient will have a second SLND followed by a systematic complete ALND.",Procedure: Sentinel LN in breast cancer recurrence,Sentinel LN in breast cancer recurrence,Experimental,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard procedure for staging of patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer.

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has also been a standard treatment for patients with early breast cancer. However, approximately 10% of patients with BCS develop ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), and mastectomy or resection of the recurrent tumor is generally performed.

There are no specific guidelines available regarding staging and treatment of the regional lymph nodes. However, the reported risk of axillary lymph node metastasis among patients with local recurrence after breast surgery and a previous negative sentinel node biopsy of 26 % is too high to be ignored.

Moreover, evaluation of the regional lymph node basins might be helpful to decide on the indication for adjuvant radiotherapy and systemic treatment. For these reasons it seems sensible to perform a regional lymph node staging procedure in patients with locally recurrent breast cancer.

In general practice, this would mean that patients with recurrent breast cancer and a previous negative sentinel node biopsy would receive an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and that patients with a previous ALND would receive no additional axillary staging.

Lymphatic drainage after previous breast surgery and/or radiotherapy would be altered and it remains questionable whether SLNB at the time of surgery for IBTR (second SLNB) is technically feasible and ALND can safely be omitted.

In this study, investigators propose for all patients the realization of SLNB procedure and systematically ALND whatever the results of SLNB analysis, only on patients previously treated with breast conservative surgery.

The aim of this study is to evaluate on a homogeneous prospective multicentric cohort of patients the feasibility and the accuracy of a second SLNB procedure for IBTR.",Sentinel Lymph Node Procedure in Ipsilateral Invasive Breast Cancer Relapse,"December 3, 2020",Actual,Invasive Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,"FIGARO is a prospective multicentre phase-2 study that aims to evaluate technical feasibility and validity of performing second sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in patients with IBTR .

To be included, patients must have a biopsy assessing an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, and a diagnosis of invasive carcinoma after a previous diagnosis of breast cancer that has been treated by breast conservative surgery at least one year before (time between the end of the previous radiotherapy and the diagnosis of recurrence).

At time of recurrence, the patients must be evaluated by X-ray mammography and ultrasonography examination of breast and axilla, and a full general assessment to eliminate distant metastasis.

Local recurrences will be operated by breast conservative surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. The decision between BCS and mastectomy will be carefully considered, in accordance with patient preference and other clinical features such as tumor location, tumor size, and breast size taken into account.

Each patient will have a second SLNB followed by a systematic complete ALND. Before the SLNB procedure, each patient will have a lymphoscintigraphy to evaluate axillary and extra axillary lymphatic mapping. Lymphoscintigraphy will be performed according to previously reported standard techniques. At 2-20 h after lymphoscintigraphy, SLNB will be performed with or without a blue dye associated injection.

Whilst survival rates are high, the 5-year survival rate is 72% higher with the earliest stage breast cancer, compared to the latest disease stage. The National Health Service Breast Screening Programme invites women aged 50 to 70 years old every three years to a mammogram. By enabling earlier detection, it is estimated that the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme saves 1300 lives per year.

Despite the potential benefits of breast cancer screening, attendance is falling. Behavioural Science is a field of study concerning understanding the processes underpinning human action. Behavioural theories, such as the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour model. Recent studies have shown the application of behavioural science to screening may also facilitate uptake of invitations. However, the use of plain text messages limits which behavioural determinants can be feasibly addressed, and what techniques can be used. Video messages can allow for more complex and a broader range of behavioural change techniques to be incorporated, and therefore have greater impact upon attendance.

Whilst behavioural science-informed messages have previously been trialled by groups to facilitate breast screening attendance, their effectiveness has been variable. One of the reasons for this, is that text messages are of limited length and formatting capability, thus restricting the number of behavioural channge techniques that can be included. Moreover, some behavioural techniques are more complex than others, and plain text can limit the extent to which these can be feasibly incorporated. Video messaging provides a delivery mechanism that may enable more complex, and different combinations to be trialled. There is however, a paucity of data regarding the impact of sending a video-based behavioural science message upon attendance rates at breast cancer screening programmes. This study looks to investigate the impact of a video-message, compared to behavioural science-based text messages and standard reminder messages.

The primary object is to determine the impact of behavioural science informed (1) video and (2) text messages compared to usual care, upon uptake of breast cancer screening.

The study will last over 6 months. The administrative hub for the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. in London is based at the Royal Free Hospital, who will oversee invitation scheduling, message delivery and outcome data collation through their existing delivery systems.

Participants will be randomised using simple randomisation method in a 1:1:1 fashion to either intervention arm or usual care. Randomisation will utilise a computerised system in which each participant who is due for screening in the study period is randomly allocated a number corresponding to the message they will receive. This will be undertaken by the screening hub, and will be passed on to the message delivery service who will ensure the correct template is sent.

Written invitations are sent, as standard practice, by the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. to invite women to either (1) an appointment at a set time, date and location (so-called timed invitations) or (2) to call and book an appointment (or open invitation). Following this, as part of usual care, those selected for open invitations will receive a first text message 7 days post written invitation. They will then receive two text message reminders, 7 days and 2 days prior to the appointment, once it has been booked. Those who receive timed invitations will just receive the two reminder messages, 7 and 2 days prior to the appointment. The decision to offer an individual a timed or open invitation is made by the screening service based on their pandemic recovery process, and will not be altered by this project.

This randomised controlled trial will involve randomising participants to receive the usual care messages (according to the timings outlined above), a plain text message incorporating or the behavioural message with a new link to a video incorporating more behavioural techniques.

The content of the intervention messages, and the video have been developed through extensive Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement work including 10 interviews, 2 focus groups and 2 co-design workshops. Members of the public have been consulted throughout the process, especially regarding the representations of individuals in the video, and the message content. The feedback received has been used to alter the materials, and further feedback received. Through this iterative approach we have ensured content is appropriate. We have also sought feedback from members of community groups working in mental health services specifically for African Caribbean and Arabic Speaking adults, and trans-led organisation to improve the quality of life of trans people, to ensure individuals from these groups are happy with representations. Screening commissioners at National Health Service England have also approved this content. The National Health Service Identity team have provided approvals for the use of National Health Service logos/branding, and the team at London Northwest Healthcare National Health Service Trust approved the use of their name.

The video will be hosted on a private page on the Imperial College London website, which will be available only to those who have been sent the link. The video will be translated into several languages, with voice overs also available in different languages, to ensure people from a diverse background are able to understand the content.

"Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients will be offered a brief distress screening questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), around the time of their breast cancer diagnosis and again at subsequent transitions in care as appropriate (e.g., the initiation of chemotherapy).",Behavioral: Distress screening,Intervention,,"Many breast cancer patients experience psychological distress during their cancer care journey. There are effective treatments for breast cancer patients experiencing distress, such as individual or group therapy, health education, and medication. Unfortunately, clinicians may not be aware of the symptoms of distress in their breast cancer patients, and some breast cancer patients who could benefit from referral to behavioral health specialists are overlooked. New guidelines recommend that all cancer patients be regularly screened for distress. However, there are unanswered questions about the impact of distress screening conducted on a large scale. Few studies have evaluated the impact of distress screening on important outcomes in breast cancer patients, such as patient experience and use of health care services, as compared to the usual care offered by the health care organization. In addition, oncology clinicians may be uncertain about the benefits of large-scale distress screening, and pilot screening programs have not been uniformly successful particularly in the community oncology setting.

The overarching goals of this study are to assess the effectiveness of implementing a guideline-recommended distress screening program for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients on improving identification and referral to treatment for highly distressed breast cancer patients, to assess patient-reported outcomes, health services utilization, and implementation outcomes of the program. This study will address two main research questions: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a guideline-recommended distress screening program for breast cancer patients in improving identification of distressed patients, initiation and completion of referrals to behavioral health, and patient-reported and utilization outcomes as compared to usual care; 2) Identify the barriers, facilitators, and other implementation-related outcomes related to distress screening in the community oncology setting.

Breast cancer patients are at risk for physical and psychosocial harms. Among the most highly prevalent psychosocial issues in breast cancer patients is psychological distress. Distress is defined and assessed as psychiatric morbidity or prevalence of psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. It is estimated that 40-50% of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will experience distress in the year following diagnosis. There is a rich literature on the persistent negative effects of distress in breast cancer patients, including associations with decreased physical and social functioning, increased symptom burden, higher utilization of inpatient and emergency services, and poor quality of life. Psychological distress can also adversely affect individual work productivity, and contributes to the rising costs of cancer care.

Recent guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and others recommend routine distress screening for breast cancer patients, recognizing the availability of effective treatments for psychological distress. Unfortunately distress remains under-detected and undertreated in breast cancer patients and rates of adherence to ASCO and other guidelines is very low. Low rates of screening might be explained in part by limited evidence of effectiveness: while efficacy of distress screening has been demonstrated in small-scale trials at academic centers, typically showing increases in number of referrals to psychosocial services, evidence supporting the effectiveness of large scale distress screening programs under routine practice conditions is limited. It is currently unknown if distress screening of breast cancer patients will improve identification of distressed patients or referrals to behavioral health services in non-academic settings. In addition, extant efficacy studies generally fail to measure key impacts and outcomes desired from distress screening, such as patient-reported outcomes (e.g., distress management, satisfaction) and changes in health care utilization (e.g., changes in emergency department use). Implementation-related factors and outcomes have also been largely overlooked in prior research (e.g., clinician acceptability, fidelity of delivery), leaving serious gaps in the understanding of barriers to adoption of distress screening programs and gaps in the knowledge needed to facilitate large-scale, routine implementation of screening.

The overarching goal of this study is to implement and evaluate a guideline-based distress screening program for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, measuring its effectiveness and impacts on key outcomes and examining barriers and facilitators to routine adoption. There is a critical need for translational research to assess the effectiveness of distress screening programs in improving (a) identification of distress, (b) referral for services, (c) outcomes for breast cancer patients in real-world oncology settings, and in understanding implementation barriers and facilitators. Without evidence of effectiveness, it is unlikely that clinical and operational health system leaders will invest in distress screening programs, potentially leading to serious adverse consequences. This proposed translational research is crucial in order to bridge the gap between academic studies and non-academic, community oncology practice, where the majority of breast cancer patients are treated. In addition, gaining insight and understanding into barriers and facilitators to implementation of distress screening programs is critically important. The objectives are to assess the effectiveness of the recommended screening program from the joint task force of the American Psychosocial Oncology Society, Association of Oncology Social Work, and Oncology Nursing Society on improving identification and referral to treatment for highly distressed breast cancer patients within an integrated health care system, and to assess patient-reported outcomes, health services utilization, and implementation outcomes of the program.

Specific Aims:

Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of a guideline-recommended distress screening program for breast cancer patients in improving identification of distressed patients, initiation and completion of referrals to behavioral health, and patient-reported and utilization outcomes as compared to usual care within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), using a pragmatic cluster randomized control trial design at six medical centers.

Aim 2: Identify patient-, clinician-, and system-level barriers and facilitators to implementation of the program, and assess stakeholder-perceived acceptability, fidelity, and achievements of the program.

Study Methods The setting for this research is Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large, integrated health care system with 14 medical centers serving a highly diverse population of over 4 million members. The investigators will use a novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design that allows for dual study of the clinical effectiveness and implementation-related factors to address the need for evidence in both areas. This study will employ mixed methods, collecting both qualitative and quantitative data as appropriate to address the study aims. To evaluate effectiveness, this study will use a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) design, clustered at the medical center level, and will implement the program at the intervention sites and offering screening to all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, the investigators will collect structured data from the KPSC electronic record (referral initiation/completion, use of health services) and patient-reported data (functioning, symptom management). Existing work from a pilot primary care-based distress screening program will be leveraged for this research, demonstrating the feasibility of this study. Implementation outcomes will be assessed with qualitative and survey data.

Knowledge gained from this research will be used to inform the continued development and implementation of systematic distress screening programs for breast cancer patients, and will enrich the evidence base by providing critical information on relevant patient- and system-level outcomes. These results will have an impact on the quality of life and quality of care for these patients, and will directly influence distress screening program adoption, scale-up, and spread, making this work highly relevant to breast cancer patients throughout California and across the nation.","Inclusion Criteria:

Although inroads have been made with more sensitive imaging techniques for earlier detection of breast cancer, these techniques are limited by the size of lesion that could be detected. Alternatively, several blood proteomic biomarkers have been proposed but none offer as of yet sufficient predictive power. Consequently, effective non-invasive tools as prognostic indicators and biomarkers of breast cancer are urgently needed.

In Brazil, it is second only to non-melanoma skin cancer. Breast cancer is a feared disease in the female universe because it is considered one of the major causes of death due to neoplasia among women. It brings also the stigma of suffering, mutilation, loss of female identity and loss of body contour. Among other issues, problems with body self-image may have an impact on sexuality and fertility, and also, the incapacity to breastfeed. Breast reconstruction can restore the patient's shape and physical integrity, among other benefits. The research justifies itself because information about the satisfaction of breast reconstruction can be achieved. It is also known that women having breast reconstruction after a mastectomy due to cancer have a favorable evolution.

Triple negative breast cancer,Genetic: BRCA1 BRCA2 PTEN PALB2 mutation,Triple negative breast cancer,Experimental,"Breast cancer triples negatives (TN; 15 % of the cases) are characterized by a high histoprognostic grade, a strong proliferation, a strong metastatic power, and a worse prognosis than the other forms of breast cancer. It is however a heterogenous group for histological and molecular level, but also for evolution. Most of the TN is part of the basal breast cancer subcategory. Until now, the medical treatment is based on chemotherapy.

Breast cancers by constitutional mutation of BRCA1 / BRCA2 (5 % of breast cancers) are mostly of basal type and their prognostic seems better that what could be expected from high grade tumours and without hormonal receptors. They would be much more frequent in the TN group. However, at this day, no prospective study was led to estimate this incidence, or to study the intervention of other genes of predisposition, as well to analyse the links between this phenotype and their consequences at the germinal or somatic level, in terms of associated molecular changes and prognosis.

The purpose of this study is, on a prospective study, to lead a joined analysis at the germinal level, in search of mutations of the main genes of breast cancer predisposition (BRCA1/2, PALB2, PTEN, PALB2), and at the tumour level (tissue micro-array and transcriptome), by correlating these results to the main clinical parameters.

There have been only a handful of high quality studies of homeopathy on the treatment of cancer, despite its widespread use for this condition.

In a recent prospective observational study done in Germany with cancer patients in two differently treated cohorts it was observed that an improvement in quality of life was observed in patients taking the addition of homeopathic treatment. In the laboratory, research on homeopathy and cancer that does exist is limited but has some clues for effects that cannot be ignored. A study that was conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, revealed that four ultradilute remedies (Carcinosin, Phytolacca, Conium, and Thuja) exerted preferential cytotoxic effects against two breast cancer cell lines, causing cell cycle delay/arrest and apoptosis without affecting the normal mammary epithelial cells. Since patients with advanced breast cancer are the highest CAM users amongst patients affected by cancer, it was thought that a feasibility study with this group of patients, would be a rational first step in proceeding to evaluate this controversial method of care, if it has merit or not.

The objective of this study is to conduct a feasibility study at Meir Oncology Institute examining whether patients with advanced breast cancer would follow a homeopathic protocol for three to six months. The primary aim of the study is to establish if patients with advanced breast cancer in Meir Oncology Institute would follow homeopathic protocol as used by Dr Banerji in India, for six months.

Primary

To describe the influence of social, environmental, and psychological factors (sociality of medication intake, life-events, understanding of prevention, clinical situation) on the decision of women at risk for breast cancer as to whether or not to take chemoprevention agents.

Secondary

To determine the implications of and influences on decision-making that a diagnosis of ""being at risk for breast cancer"" has for women.
To determine what factors hinder women from taking chemoprevention for breast cancer.
To field test a questionnaire that identifies the factors that influence the decision-making process of women at increased risk of breast cancer for whom chemoprevention is a medically indicated option.
To describe the influence of social, environmental, and psychological factors on the decision of women at risk for breast cancer as to whether or not to take chemoprevention agents by menopausal status.
For postmenopausal women who decide to take a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) for breast cancer prevention, to assess reasons for the choice of raloxifene versus tamoxifen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Participants undergo a counseling session about their increased risk for breast cancer and the use of a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM), tamoxifen citrate or raloxifene, to reduce breast cancer risk. Some participants may have their counseling session video-recorded. They are also asked to review the video with their interviewers and to be contacted for a brief follow-up telephone interview.

Participants then complete an initial questionnaire to assess recall and understanding of risk information given to them during the counseling session. This first questionnaire is completed preferably on the same day of counseling before leaving the clinic or office. Participants also have the option to take the questionnaire home and return it to the study site within 2 weeks. Participants who return the first questionnaire complete a second one before leaving the clinic or office, or receive it by mail with a returned self-addressed stamped envelope. Participants who indicate on the second questionnaire that they do not want to take a SERM are asked to complete an online questionnaire. Participants who have not made a decision about SERM use within 3 months after counseling are contacted by telephone. They also receive the second questionnaire by mail 3 months after the telephone contact.

Interviewers, doctors, or other health-care professionals also complete questionnaires that indicate what was discussed during counseling sessions.","Inclusion criteria

- Some bacteria found in the large and small intestines help keep people healthy and aid digestion. They may also affect a person s risk of developing cancer.

Objectives:

- To study intestinal bacteria and its relationship to urine-based markers of breast cancer risk in women.

Eligibility:

- Women between 55 and 69 years of age with a recent mammogram that showed no signs of cancer.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history and basic health questionnaire.

This proposed study builds upon a pilot within the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) that identified highly acceptable methods for collecting fecal specimens and significant correlation between fecal microbial beta-glucuronidase activity and a marker of breast cancer risk, urine levels of estrogens. The proposed study will determine the correlation between levels of fecal enzyme activities and systemic estrogens in a random sample of postmenopausal women at Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO). Demonstration of an association between the fecal microbiota and systemic estrogens would help to motivate future studies of how microbes affect cancer risk.

Objectives: The main objective is to characterize the fecal microbiota and its association with levels of systemic estrogens among randomly sampled postmenopausal female members of a health maintenance organization (HMO). A secondary objective will determine the proportions of women who consent and then provide questionnaire data, a fecal specimen to characterize the microbiota, and a urine specimen to quantify systemic estrogens; and differences between participants (N=60) and non-participants. A third objective will determine whether consecutive, newly diagnosed postmenopausal breast cancer cases have similar participation rates, fecal microbiota characteristics and urine estrogen levels compared to the randomly sampled women.

Methods: We will randomly sample from the KPCO population of approximately 50,000 women ages 55-69 who have recently had a negative screening mammogram. An invitation packet (letter, information pamphlet, consent form, eligibility questionnaire, and opt-out postcard) will be sent in batches of 100, up to a maximum of 500 women. The consenting women will receive a second packet with a cancer risk-factor questionnaire, a link to the on-line Block brief food frequency questionnaire, and a specimen collection kit (with illustrated instructions) for collecting a fecal and urine specimen. Participants (minimum 60, maximum 80) will ship the specimens to the DCEG repository. As amended, consecutive newly diagnosed breast cancer cases (target N=60) will be enrolled in the oncology clinic prior to definitive surgery, with the same eligibility criteria as for the random sample. For contemporaneous controls, participants in the randomly sampled, mammogram-negative population will be recruited back (target N=60). Urine estrogens will be quantified by DCEG at NCI Frederick. Fecal microbial classification and enzymatic expression and activity will be performed at the University of Maryland Medical School (UMMS).

Analyses: Data will be analyzed and summarized for publication with representatives from KPCO, DCEG and UMMS. Simple proportions will be used to estimate participation rates. Extant electronic records at KPCO will be used to compare participants to non-participants, overall and by pre-specified subgroups (5-year age groups, race/ethnicity, length of KPCO enrollment), with descriptive statistics and logistic regression. For the primary objective, fecal microbial 16S rRNA pyrosequences will be classified by phylogenetic and principal components analyses, while estrogen levels and Beta-glucuronidase RNA expression and enzymatic activity levels will be categorized using log standard deviations. The study will have 80% power to detect a 17% increase in estrogen level per 2.4-fold increase in glucuronidase activity and 80% power to detect a 3-fold case-control difference in above-median microbiome alpha diversity.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Molecular imaging of breast cancer associated targets is a promising method to improve visualization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging with radioactive labeled tracers. However in view of radiation safety, infrastructure, costs and stability, fluorescent labeling of bevacizumab (a VEGF targeting humanized monoclonal antibody) has potential advantages over radioactive labeling. Therefore recently the near-infrared fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye 800CW has been developed. In mice the fluorescent signal was clearly present in tumor tissue and could be visualized intra-operatively. The tracer was also approved for administration to patients in a microdose (tracer dose).

In this prospective multicenter feasibility study the new tracer bevacizumab-IRDye 800CW will be administered to a maximum of 30 patients with proven breast cancer 3 days before surgery. Part of the surgical specimen will after surgery extensively be investigated by macroscopy and microscopy to determine the uptake of the tracer in tumor tissue, surrounding normal tissue and lymph nodes. To detect the tracer before surgery, two different pre-operative imaging methods are used: MSOT (in the UMCG en FDOT in the UMCU. During surgery the intra-operative MFRI camera is available at both centers to detect the fluorescent signal.

The study consists of a total of five study procedure related patient visits.

During a screening visit, eligibility will be evaluated and patient characteristics will be collected.

Primary

Determine the safety of vaccination comprising allogeneic sargramostim (GM-CSF)-secreting breast cancer cells with or without immunomodulation using cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in women with stage IV breast cancer.
Determine the doses of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin that maximize vaccine-induced immunity, in terms of immune response to HER2/neu, in patients treated with these regimens.
Compare in vivo immune response induced by these regimens, as measured by immunohistochemical analysis of vaccine site biopsies from these patients, with responses seen in prior preclinical and clinical studies.

Secondary

Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study.

The first 6 patients receive 1 of 2 doses of vaccine comprising allogeneic sargramostim (GM-CSF)-secreting breast cancer cells intradermally (ID) on day 0. Subsequent patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day -1, vaccine at the higher dose ID on day 0, and doxorubicin IV on day 7. Treatment in all patients repeats every 4-6 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after the third course receive a fourth course of treatment at approximately 4 months after completion of the third course.

Cohorts of 2-3 patients receive a fixed dose of vaccine in combination with escalating doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Doses of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin are escalated until an optimal dose of combination chemotherapy with a fixed dose of vaccine is achieved.

Patients are followed at 1 month and 4 months after completion of study therapy and then annually thereafter.

We will use data from more than 13,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2012 to determine how well each test works. We will measure the tests' effectiveness at finding second cancers, and estimate the likelihood of different outcomes. We will also determine whether one test appears to work better than the other to detect second breast cancers among different groups of women. We will then develop patient decision aids to help women and their doctors make more-informed choices about surveillance.

Higher level of oestradiol produced in postmenopausal women through aromatization of androgens in the adipose tissues and higher level of insulin, a condition common in obese women, are linked to poorer prognosis in breast cancer. A possible interaction between leptin, insulin and obesity-related markers of inflammation have also been linked to breast cancer outcomes. Non-biological mechanisms could include chemotherapy under-dosing in obese women, suboptimal treatment, and obesity-related complications.

The impact of body mass index on treatment outcome in patients receiving endocrine therapy, there have been consistent results indicating that the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors vary with body mass index; however, the efficacy of tamoxifen is not body mass index-dependent. In the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, which compared the efficacy of anastrozole against tamoxifen as an adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive post-menopausal breast cancer patients, anastrozole, a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, was significantly less effective in post-menopausal breast cancer patients with a high body mass index, whereas an equal efficacy of tamoxifen was shown across all body mass index levels.

One of the most perspective direction of the oncotherapy is anticancer immunotherapy - employment of inhibitors of immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints inhibitors (such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies) have shown good clinical efficiency in clinical research to cure such malignant tumor with high mutation load, as melanoma, lung cancer, and others.

One of the hypothesis of such effect states that, usually, more cancer neoantigens are synthetized in the tumors with high mutation load (driven by genome instability), causing severe lymphoid infiltration [2-3]. This situation is balanced by overexpression of such inhibitors of the immune response as PD-1 and PD-L1 [4 - 6].

Breast cancer - is relatively heterogenic tumor, with different genetic, morphological and phenotypic forms.

Despite relatively low expression of PD-L1 in BC in general, there are reasons to believe that genetic instability, driven by mutations in genes involved in DNA repair, can increase the immunogenicity and, thus, the expression of PD-L1 in BC.

To date, it is widely accepted that 5-10% of BC cases are represented by hereditary types, i.e. mediated by germline pathogenic mutations in genes of DNA reparation pathways. Hereditary breast cancer (HBC), as well as ovarian cancer (OC), сaused by mutations in genes BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, TP53 и PTEN, and others. Thus, one of the promising directions here is to understand the inter-relation among germline pathogenic mutations associated with HBC, and activity of PD-L1. It would allow to optimize selection of anti-PD-L1 therapy, by forming group of patients (matching criteria of HBC) with high level of PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.","Inclusion Criteria:

Study participants in Group 1 will include patients prescribed neoadjuvant systemic therapy (including trastuzumab and pertuzumab) by their treating oncologist for a diagnosis of HER2 positive early breast cancer.,Other: Acquisition of blood samples and tumour tissue samples (biopsies),Group 1: Early HER2 positive breast cancer,,"The treatment of breast cancer is determined by its 'receptor (or signal) status'. Receptors are signals present on all cells and if abnormal can drive cancer growth. One of the signals that can drive breast cancer growth is the HER2 receptor/signal. One quarter of all breast cancers are found to have too many HER2 signals i.e. HER2-positive breast cancer.

HER2 is a member of the HER-family which constitutes HER1,HER2,HER3,and HER4 signals. Currently, tests can identify breast cancers with too much HER2, from a biopsy, so a cancer doctor can prescribe anti-HER2 treatment to block these signals. These drugs have improved survival rates in HER2-positive breast cancer. Members of the HER family can also 'pair' with each other to activate signals that encourage cancer growth. For example, HER3 naturally 'pairs' with HER2. Though anti-cancer drugs have been developed to target this pairing, the current method of patient selection is not developed to detect pairing of signals in tissue biopsies. A specialist imaging technique called FLIM-FRET (FLIM- Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy; FRET- Forster resonance energy transfer) can identify signal pairing on cancer cells from tissue, and potentially, from blood samples.

This study involves having blood tests while participants receive anti-HER2 treatment. The investigators will also seek permission to take samples of cancer tissue from the biopsies that were already carried out, e.g. at diagnosis. Some participants may need an additional biopsy, which will be discussed with participants prior to consent. This study will use the specialist FLIM-FRET technique to measure the signal pairing in tumour samples and blood samples. Investigators will measure if the levels of signal pairing from blood are the same as that from tissue, which could lead to bloods tests being used to select patients for anti-HER2 treatments, instead of invasive tissue biopsies. Changes in signal pairing may also help to predict if a cancer is becoming resistant to treatment.",A Study to Measure the Expression of the HER2-HER3 Dimer in Tumour and Blood (Exosomes) Samples From Patients With HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Receiving HER2 Targeted Therapies,June 2023,Anticipated,HER2-positive Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,"The study will recruit 40 participants to two groups as outlined below:

Convenience sample of partners/significant others/spouses of breast cancer survivors,,Partners of breast cancer survivors,,"The concept of self-efficacy is a major predictor of physical, psychological, social and overall quality of life (QoL) among breast cancer survivors (BCS). Because survivor and partner outcomes are often linked, it is reasonable to hypothesize that self-efficacy is an important predictor of physical, psychological, social and overall QoL in partners as well. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested, in part because no scale exists to measure cancer-related self-efficacy in partners. Development and psychometric testing of such a scale is a critical first step in developing a theoretical model predicting QoL in this population. Partners of BCS often report lower QoL compared to partners of healthy women, making them an important focus of research. During the award period, the applicant will follow standard instrument development procedures to develop the Breast Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale for Partners (BCSES-P) and test the scale's psychometric properties using a large and diverse sample of partners of breast cancer survivors.",Breast Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale for Partners,"March 1, 2022",Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,"Compared to partners of healthy women, partners of breast cancer survivors (BCS) are at an increased risk of affective disorders, including depression and anxiety;1 are more likely to report antidepressant use for up to 14 years after their partners' diagnosis and treatment; and more likely to report lower vitality and more quality of life deficits.2 Despite these significant negative health outcomes, partners of BCS have rarely been studied and factors that contribute to their QoL have not been identified. Because these factors would serve as targets of interventions to improve well-being in this population, this represents a significant gap.

In BCS, self-efficacy, one's belief in one's ability to handle a situation, is positively related to quality of life (QoL) and has a protective effect against psychological morbidity.5 In this population, self-efficacy is an important predictor of a wide range of outcomes including: attention function, anxiety, depression, marital satisfaction, sexuality, self-esteem,6 fear of recurrence,7 subjective memory impairment, physical activity,8 health behaviors,9 and satisfaction with healthcare provider communication.7 Given the importance of self-efficacy in predicting QoL and health outcomes of BCS, it is reasonable to hypothesize that self-efficacy in partners is associated with these factors as well. However, without a scale to measure partners' cancer-related self-efficacy, this hypothesis cannot be tested and our ability to build theoretically based interventions to fully address partners' QoL is severely limited.

Previous studies measuring partners' self-efficacy have utilized generic self-efficacy scales that fail to address the unique challenges and experiences that partners of BCS face. For other types of cancer (e.g., prostate), partner self-efficacy scales have been adapted from survivors. Because existing scales do not target the unique experience of being partnered with a BCS, a valid and reliable scale to measure self-efficacy in this population is needed.

Furthermore, a theoretical framework for testing construct validity is needed. Ferrell and Dow's Quality of Life Model will provide the theoretical foundation for the Breast Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale for Partners (BCSES-P).

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and psychometrically test the Breast Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale for Partners (BCSES-P). The specific aims are as follows:

Qualitative Aim 1: To develop a new measure of cancer-related self-efficacy in partners (""BCSES-P"") and obtain feedback on the items from partners of breast cancer survivors.

Quantitative Aim 2. To evaluate the psychometric properties of the BCSES-P in a diverse sample of partners.

Hypothesis 2.1: The BCSES-P will be unidimensional as assessed by exploratory factor analysis.

Hypothesis 2.2: The BCSES-P will demonstrate an internal consistency coefficient of 0.70 or above.

Hypothesis 2.3: Construct validity of the BCSES-P will be demonstrated by support of the following theoretical relationships:

Cancer-related self-efficacy will be positively related to marital satisfaction and sexual functioning (social well-being) and the distal outcome, overall QoL.
Cancer-related self-efficacy will be negatively related to fatigue (physical well-being), fear of recurrence, depression, and anxiety (psychological well-being).

INNOVATION

This study supports three significant innovations. First, the BCSES-P will be the first scale to measure self-efficacy in partners of BCS, and the only scale developed with partner input. Previous scales have been adapted from survivor scales without consideration of partner-specific concerns. Second, putting self-efficacy into the context of QoL highlights a holistic approach to studying the long-term effects of breast cancer on partners. Third, because self-efficacy is an important predictor of well-being in survivor research and is expected to be in partner research as well, the development of the BCSES-P will allow the foundational research needed to develop novel interventions to increase well-being in this population.

PROCEDURES

The scale will be developed according to standard instrument development procedures and will occur in 2 phases. Phase 1 is composed of 5 stages: 1) literature review, (2) focus groups, (3) development of candidate items, (4) cognitive interviewing, and (5) finalization of scale items.15 Phase 2 will include a large-scale psychometric evaluation of the scale.

Phase 1

Stage I: Literature review. The applicant will conduct an exploratory systematic review of theoretical and empirical literature on the experiences of partners of BCS using the PubMed, Psychlit, and CINAHL databases. Studies that focus on self-efficacy in BCS and partners/caregivers or on the issues and concerns of these populations will be examined. The search criteria/procedures will be reviewed by the applicant's research team. In addition, the applicant will compile a list of all existing scales that measure self-efficacy or related constructs in partners of persons with cancer and related illnesses. This information will be presented to the research team and selected content experts, scientists and clinicians with expertise in self-efficacy in cancer populations. Based on this review, a set of potential candidate items for the scale will be developed.

Stage II: Focus groups. Two focus groups will be conducted by the applicant following standard procedures as outlined by Krueger and Casey. Each group will be composed of 8 partners. A semi-structured interview guide will be used to direct the interviews. The partners will be asked about the experiences, issues and concerns they experience related to their partners' breast cancer; how they manage or handled these issues/concerns; and their understanding of the concept of self-efficacy as it relates to their own experiences. The focus groups interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Standard content analytic procedures and a variety of data matrices will be used to organize, analyze, and interpret the focus group interview data. The analytic product will be a list and description of categories, which will be presented to the research team. A set of potential candidate items will be developed based on these categories.

Stage III: Development of candidate items. Three sets of potential candidate items will be presented to and discussed by the research team. First, select items from the BCSES7 will be modified for partners. For example, the item Handle any fears about breast cancer returning would be modified to read Handle any fears about my partner's breast cancer returning. The other sets of candidate items will be those developed in Stages I and II. Through discussion, consensus, and review of data, the team will develop a preliminary scale consisting of a pool of items that the team determines reflects the domains and content of the construct of breast-cancer-related self-efficacy in partners.

Stage IV: Cognitive interviewing. The applicant will conduct cognitive interviewing with 10 individual partners using the ""think-aloud"" method as described by Willis.18 The participants will asked to think aloud as they answer each item, making their cognitive processes explicit. Each partner will be asked to discuss how he/she responded to the question and what the item meant to him/her. The applicant will query the participant about the clarity and relevance of each item. Once the partner has answered all questions, the interviewer will ask the partners to reflect on the overall acceptability of the scale including any issues with its ease of use, its comprehensiveness (e.g., issues not addressed), and burden.

Stage V: Scale development. The applicant will present the results of the cognitive interviewing to the research team and based on further discussion, the team will modify items, develop new items if needed, and finalize the scale for psychometric testing. The scale will be sent to the IRB for review prior to phase 3 large scale data collection and psychometric testing.

Phase 2

Preliminary psychometric testing. Using funding already received, a sample of 150 partners will be obtained through 4 venues to answer an online questionnaire: Facebook(cite), inResearch.org, Army of Love, and ResNet (the latter three are research participant registries). Partners will complete the finalized self-efficacy scale and related scales.

Data Analysis Plan for Phase 2: The PI will conduct data analysis in conjunction with the study statistician. Data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 24.0. A description of procedures to evaluate the psychometric properties of the instrument follows.

Dimensionality of the BCSES-P will be conducted using the principal component method for factor extraction. Varimax rotation will be performed to maximize the distance among factors. To assess the appropriateness of the factor model, three diagnostics test will be examined: (1) Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, (2) Bartlett's test for sphericity, and (3) the determinant of the correlation matrix. The scree plot and eigenvalues will first be examined to determine the optimal number of components. Eigenvalues equal to or greater than 1.0 will be extracted.19 If more than one factor is extracted, the rotated component matrix will then be examined to determine which items have the strongest loadings on each of the retained components. Individual items will be assessed for conceptual relevance and consistency in relation to the remaining items within each component. The specified factors will be labeled according to conceptual content.

Internal consistency reliability of the BCSES-P will be assessed through descriptive statistics, detailed item analysis, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Item means and standard deviations will be assessed using the criterion that item means should be near the scale mid-point with a high degree of variability so items adequately measure a range of possible values without encountering a floor or ceiling effect.20 Item-level statistics will be examined by assessing: (1) an inter-item correlation matrix; (2) the average inter-item correlation coefficient; (3) the corrected item-to-total correlation coefficient; and (4) information regarding the alpha if the item is deleted. Items that have correlations between .30 and .70 with less than 50% of the items will be examined closely.21

Construct validity of the BCSES-P will also be examined using Ferrell and Dow's Quality of Life Model,13,14 which identifies four domains of QoL that contribute to overall QoL: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. The specific scales to be used to measure variables in each of these QoL domains were selected from a published study pertaining to development of a Breast Cancer Survivor Self-Efficacy Scale (BCSES).7 The investigators will use the following scales to establish construct validity of the BCSES-P: fatigue (physical well-being), fear of recurrence, depression, and anxiety (psychological well-being), marital satisfaction and sexual functioning (social well-being) and overall QoL. Convergent validity coefficients will be estimated by correlations between BCSES-P and other instruments. Examined relationships will be based on the theoretical relationships proposed in the model. Construct validity would be supported by demonstrating moderate to strong correlations in the hypothesized convergent direction between the BCSES-P and proximal and distal outcome measures in the model.","Inclusion Criteria:

African American women with breast cancer have greater risk of recurrence, shorter overall survival, shorter survival after relapse, worse toxicity and worse cosmetic outcome than their Caucasian counterparts. These differences in outcome persist even when controlling for age, and stage at presentation. Being similarly treated with modern breast conserving therapy (lumpectomy and adjuvant whole breast irradiation) at recognized centers of excellence does little to alleviate the disparities in outcomes. Controlling for socioeconomic factors decreases the severity of these disparities, but it does not completely explain them. Theories abound as to the cause of outcome inequality. Many of these theories take either a psychosocial, or biologic bent. One potential biologic cause may be chemokine and cytokine expression.

Chemokines and cytokines (chemo/cytokines) are proteins and peptides used for cell signaling. Primarily secreted by T cells and macrophages, they influence cellular activation, differentiation, and function and act as mediators for inflammatory and immune responses. There has been substantial research linking some of these chemo/cytokines [Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), interleukin (IL)-6,and IL-8] to tumor promotion and progression. For example, TNFα has been linked to greater cell survival despite genomic injury which in turn leads to greater genetic alterations and malignant transformation. TNFα has been associated with breast cancer progression and metastases. Blocking the receptor for PDGF appears to decrease the metastatic potential of breast cancer cell lines. TGFβ inhibits T cell and B cell lymphocytes and natural killer cell cytotoxicity. This immuno-suppression has been shown to promote tumor progression in mammary cancer cells lines. The ability of TGFβ to promote tumor progression is so well recognized that it has become a therapeutic target by some researchers. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) has been shown to inhibit mammary cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, Lyon et al reported significantly higher circulating levels of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-8 in women with breast cancer compared to women with a negative breast biopsy. Additionally, researchers have directly correlated increased levels of IL-6 with the development and progression of breast cancer, and decreased overall survival (OAS). Conclusion: Expression of certain chemokines and cytokines is associated with development and progression of breast cancer.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

The most important factor in ensuring that the cancer does not return in the breast is to ensure that it is completely removed during surgery. Complete removal is dependent on having a rim of normal tissue (clear margin) surrounding the cancer. If the margin is positive, or the cancer recurs, more surgery or mastectomy is required. Approximately one third of breast cancers are detected by mammograms or ultrasounds and cannot be felt by patients or physicians. Accordingly, a localization technique is required to help the surgeon to find and remove the cancer. The current technique (needle localization) has a higher chance of having cancer cells at the margin. This is a study about a surgical technique. The objective of this comparison study is to determine whether a new technique (radioguided seed localization) is a better way to remove nonpalpable breast cancers.

Over the past twenty years, the mortality from BC in LA has also been increasing very rapidly, and is currently the leading cause of cancer mortality among LA women. The large number of incident BC cases among premenopausal women, which is only partly explained by the population age-structure, is therefore of major concern.

Volunteer milk donors,,Volunteers,,"Background:

- At present, women do not have very accurate tests to inform of them of their personal risk of developing breast cancer. More information on the changes associated with both benign and cancerous breast lesions will help develop better risk information. Researchers have been looking at cells found in breast milk to study genetic changes related to breast cancer. However, most of these cell samples have been collected from white women. A new study wants to collect breast milk samples from African American women for further research. Comparing the results of genetic tests will help improve understanding of breast cancer risk in all women.

Objectives:

- To study genetic changes related to breast lesions, including breast cancer, in African American women.

Eligibility:

- African American women at least 18 years of age who are nursing a baby and who either have had or are being considered for a breast biopsy.

Design:

Participants will be screened with personal health questions.
Participants will receive a box with sterile bottles for milk collection. They will collect two breast milk samples, one from each breast. They will also fill out a questionnaire about their medical history.
The box with the samples and the questionnaire will be returned to the clinical center for study.
After the box is returned, participants will be asked to provide a copy of the biopsy report for any breast biopsies they have had.
There will be a followup phone call every year. Participants will provide health history information. This information will include whether they have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the previous year.",Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women,"March 27, 2020",Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,,,,"Increasing evidence supports the importance of the role of pregnancy, lactation and post-weaning breast remodeling in the etiology of certain types of early onset aggressive breast cancers, including basal breast cancers, which are difficult to detect and treat and disproportionately affect African American women. Thus, improving methods for detecting or preventing early onset tumors is important from a clinical, public health and racial disparities perspective. Recent evidence indicates that analysis of breast milk during the postpartum period may advance the discovery of mechanisms and biomarkers related to risk of early onset, aggressive tumors. However, developing methods for collecting, processing and testing milk for biomarkers poses challenges.

A research team co-led by Drs. Mark Sherman (NCI/DCEG/HREB) and Kathleen Arcaro (University of Massachusetts) has received an NIH Bench-to-Bedside award for a project entitled, Molecular Epidemiology of Postpartum Involution of the Breast: Development and Demonstration of Tools for Understanding the Postpartum Period in Relation to Risk for Early Onset Breast Cancer. The specific bench objectives of this project include:

To develop improved methods for fractionating breast milk into epithelial cell rich and liquid components
To optimize assays for DNA methylation, proliferation, apoptosis, p16 expression and telomere lengths using epithelial enriched breast milk fractions, and
To develop assays for TGF-beta ligands, prolactin and sex -steroid hormone using liquid milk fractions.

To achieve these objectives, NCI will initially work with fresh specimens that are being prospectively collected under the University of Massachusetts IRB-approved open protocol entitled Epigenetics and Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women , funded by the Avon Foundation for Women. Dr. Arcaro s lab is studying breast cancer risk and promoter hypermethylation in breast cells obtained from the milk of nursing women. They have analyzed breast cells from nearly 400 women and are continuing with long-term follow-up. However, the majority of the data has been from White women. Since disease risk factors differ between ethnic groups, it is important to test risk assessment methods on a wide population. The main purpose of this specific UMass study is to extend their findings of breast cancer risk to African American women. They plan to recruit 200 lactating African American women to participate in the breast milk study. This involves collecting questionnaire data, completing methylation analyses for eight genes, archiving milk and the remaining DNA for future studies, and annual follow-up.

The key aims that we seek to address through the current protocol are related to objective (1) listed above: To develop improved methods for fractionating breast milk into epithelial cell rich and liquid components. Given that Dr. Arcaro has an IRB approved open protocol to collect fresh milk at University of Massachusetts, NCI can only pursue this collaborative aim (effectively within the timeframe of the bench-to-bedside award) in the context of this ongoing study. Specifically, the collaborative project that is the subject of this IRB application will assess the following aims through in vitro manipulation of fresh liquid milk collections: 1) the effects of modifying the initial rinse of epithelial pellets (rinse solution: saline vs. media; centrifugation speeds, temperature); 2) yields of cells and nucleic acids achievable via fractionation of milk using different types of immunomagnetic beads (coated with antibodies to remove leukocytes ( negative selection ) vs. coated with antibodies to remove epithelial cells ( positive selection ); 3) the relative preservation at room temperature at 24, 48 and 72 hours of milk suspended in cellular fixatives (e.g. formalin, Proclin) as compared to fresh milk without fixation; 4) the possibility that strategies 1 and 2 be combined. This project brings together specific experience and expertise at University of Massachusetts with regard to milk processing with technical knowledge from NCI, provided by Drs. Kopp, Heckman, Yang and Sherman. In particular, NCI Frederick and Dr. Heckman have successfully used immunomagnetic bead technology to purify epithelial cells from blood products and lactating mouse glands by removing leukocytes.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

According to estimates, approximately 46,000 women in the United States, and 130,000 women in the European Union, die due to breast cancer yearly. Early detection is of paramount importance in reducing mortality from this major public health burden. Screening mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality by 20% to 35% in women aged 40 to 69 years. Detection of small volume breast cancer at early stages is associated with a 10-year disease-free survival rate as high as 98% in patients with pT1a,bN0M0 tumors (measuring 1 cm or less, with disease-free axillary lymph nodes and no distant metastasis). The assumption that early diagnosis will lead to improved treatment outcomes has driven the search for diagnostic biomarkers.

Despite this enthusiasm, a biomarker for stage I breast cancer has been elusive. The predictive value of mammography declines in cohorts of patients with denser breast tissue and smaller lesions, and recent studies have indicated that the small amount of biomarker molecules emanating from a breast tumor of less than 1 cm is well below the sensitivity of detection for current analytical methods. In addition, biomarkers in body fluids are highly perishable. Biomarkers break down during collection, transport and storage due to endogenous degradative enzymes yielding false negatives. Thus there is a significant need for new technologies that will a) identify and measure low abundance biomarkers (less than 1 nanogram/mL), and b) is low cost and can be seamlessly integrated into the clinical workflow.

Hypothesis 2: Women randomized to the CBSM condition will show greater decreases over time in cancer-specific distress and greater increases over time in quality of life as compared to women in the CW condition over the course of the study from baseline to six month follow-up.

Despite this greater need, interventions designed to foster adaptation to disease among such women are scarce. Our recent randomized trial tested the efficacy of a 10-week multi-modal, group-based, cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention delivered in a university setting among women with breast cancer who recently completed adjuvant treatment. Using a panel of psychological, physiological, and physical indicators of adaptation, the investigators examined whether the intervention facilitated ""recovery"" or adaptation after adjuvant therapy for breast cancer had been completed. CBSM intervention participants showed improvements in multiple indicators of psychosocial adaptation (fewer intrusive thoughts, lower anxiety, less social disruption, less negative affect, more positive affect, greater benefit finding, and higher levels of positive states of mind), physiological adaptation (decreased cortisol and increased cellular immune function and Th1 cytokine production) and physical adaptation to disease (less fatigue and improved sleep quality). Many of these findings held at 3 and 9 month follow-ups. As with most psychosocial oncology research, participants in the randomized trial were mostly non-Hispanic White women. Whether or not the results of that trial are generalizable to the larger population that includes minority women needs to be tested.

The proposed research aims to translate this University-based, CBSM intervention into a format that will be acceptable and effective in a community setting. The investigators will target our efforts toward low-income African American women, (n=120 after attrition) diagnosed with breast cancer (all stages of disease). Participants will be randomized to 10-week CBSM intervention or an attention time-matched Enhanced Breast Cancer Wellness and Education (CW) active comparison-control condition and monitored for 6 months afterward. Outcomes include: (a) acceptability of the intervention, (b) psychosocial adaptation, (c) physical symptom clusters, (d) economic implications and (e) an objective indicator of stress (diurnal salivary cortisol). The main goal is to test whether a successful stress-management intervention can be effectively implemented in natural settings in the community and will be acceptable to a community-dwelling, low-income population of African American women with breast cancer.

Specific Aim 1: To examine the acceptability of an empirically-validated stress management intervention in community-dwelling low-income African American women with breast cancer.

Specific Aim 2: To test the prediction that participants randomized to CBSM intervention show significant improvements in indices of psychosocial adaptation (i.e., cancer-specific distress, quality of life) relative to women randomized to a CW attention control condition across the study period.

Specific Aim 3: To test the prediction that participants randomized to CBSM intervention show significant improvements in indices of physical symptom clusters relative to women randomized to a CW attention control condition across the study period (physical symptom clusters include pain, sleep, fatigue).

Specific Aim 4: To test the prediction that women randomized to a CBSM intervention versus CW attention control condition have better economic outcomes across the study period (as measured by faster return to work, fewer sick days, fewer health care visits).

Specific Aim 5: To test the prediction that participants randomized to CBSM intervention show significant improvements in indices of physiological adaptation relative to women randomized to a CW attention control condition across the study period by examining diurnal salivary cortisol as objective measure of stress.","Inclusion Criteria:

This is true with reference to the clinical stage at the time of presentation, the probability to metastasize and potential to recur. The idea of steroids receptor expression by the tumour is not new, and to evaluate their status prior to the induction of hormone therapy is a must.

The sex steroids, which are produced intratumorally, include estrogen, progesterone, and androgens. They act on their specific receptors present on the cell surface, within the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. It is a measurement of these receptors that decide the potential of an individual to respond to different types of hormones like estrogen receptor blockers and aromatase inhibitors. Do the histological grade of tumour bears some relation with the status of these receptors and can investigators predict and rely just on the cellular behaviour of tumour for the purpose of prognosis is still under investigation.

Breast ultrasound (US) can assess the relative amount of glandular tissue component (GTC) to the fibrous stroma in dense breast parenchyma and can reflect the degree of lobular involution. In women with dense breasts on mammography, an association between high levels of sonographic GTC, defined as the percent of glandular tissue within fibroglandular tissue, and an increased risk of breast cancer was demonstrated in a retrospective single-center study of 8483 Korean women. The purpose of this international multicenter study is to prospectively validate whether sonographic GTC is associated with subsequent breast cancer risk and whether it can provide additional information beyond established risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, breast density, family history, or benign breast disease). In this study, investigators from Asia and Europe will enroll 16164 women with dense breasts (BI-RADS density categories C and D on mammography) undergoing screening breast US using either an automated or handheld device. GTC will be assessed qualitatively as minimal, mild, moderate, or marked at the time of US interpretation and will be dichotomized into low (minimal or mild) versus high (moderate or marked). The primary outcome is a pathologic diagnosis of breast cancer, including invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Women are observed from 3 months after date of GTC assessment to breast cancer diagnosis or censoring as a result of death or end date of complete cancer capture. Covariate information will be obtained from self-report at the time of breast US examination and includes age, race/ethnicity, menopausal status, first-degree family history of breast cancer, and history of breast biopsy. The 5-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer by level of sonographic GTC will be compared based on marginal standardization with the predicted risk summed to a weighted risk according to the observed covariate distribution in the study population. The association of sonographic GTC with breast cancer risk will be estimated by using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model to account for the competing risk of death. In addition, investigators will compare the discriminatory accuracy of the breast cancer surveillance consortium (BCSC) 5-year risk score and the BCSC model integrated with sonographic GTC.","Inclusion Criteria

The ability to identify subclinical and deep-seated tumor during BCS is still difficult, and the surgeon must rely on nonspecific visual changes and manual palpation of subtle irregularities to guide cancer excision. Although there is no consensus on negative surgical margins, at least 20 % of patients undergo more than one procedure to achieve acceptable margins as part of breast-conserving strategy. The development of reliable intraoperative assessment tools which can provide a timely indication of whether re-excision in tumor bed after BCS is indicated at the time of primary surgery would be an asset.

,,,,"Routine incorporation of decision aids into oncology practice has the potential to significantly improve patients' experiences with cancer by increasing the likelihood that they make informed treatment decisions aligned with their values. Unfortunately, only a minority of the more than 1.6 million patients diagnosed annually with cancer ever receive one due to limited clinic resources for administration and challenges in timely identification of appropriate patients. Online delivery directly to patients addresses some of these barriers but is insufficient on its own to ensure accessibility for patients at the time they most benefit from support.19 It is critical that active, multi-faceted implementation strategies that target barriers to the widespread use of web-based decision aids be identified, as these tools have the potential to significantly improve the quality of oncologic care.

Based on strong preliminary work, the investigators have developed and piloted a package of implementation strategies that effectively overcomes barriers to delivery of a web-based breast cancer surgery decision aid in an academic and community clinic. Although the strategy was successful, patients were white and educated; further investigation is imperative in settings that provide care to underserved patients to ensure the intervention will mitigate, rather than worsen, existing disparities in breast cancer care. This is especially critical given that underserved patients may benefit most from shared decision-making interventions such as the one described. To study this, the investigators propose a pilot study within a clinic that serves a catchment area with a high proportion of African American, rural and low income patients. The investigators will iteratively assess and enhance our implementation package using concepts outlined in the Knowledge-to-Action Cycle, which emphasizes local context in balancing fidelity and flexibility.

,"Behavioral: SIS.NET, Routine Follow-up","SIS.NET, Routine Follow up",Active Comparator,This is a pilot study that will compare two systems of breast cancer follow up care and will evaluate a number of parameters indicating quality and efficiency of care delivery as well as patient satisfaction with care. Approximately 100 breast cancer patients who have completed the acute phase of treatment will be randomized to one of two follow up care plans.,Comparing (SIS.NET) to Standard Care in Patients Who Have Completed the Acute Phase of Treatment for Early Breast Cancer,March 2015,Actual,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Parallel Assignment,None (Open Label),Supportive Care,"Over 200,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the year 2006. Many of these women will be rendered free of cancer, but will need ongoing disease specific care and surveillance. The estimated number of breast cancer survivors in the year 2003 was 2.3 million (1). With outcomes improving after the diagnosis of early breast cancer, the number of breast cancer survivors in follow up care will continue to increase and eventually result in an unmanageable load on the subspecialties of medical and surgical oncology. Most of these patients continue to be seen by an oncology specialist for at least five years after their cancer diagnosis, but this type of follow up may not be necessary or optimally utilized.

Alternate Strategies for Health Care Delivery Studies suggest that oncology follow up care is costly to the health care system no matter who the provider is, and in some cases, diagnostic tests are overused (2). In a randomized trial of 296 women with a history of breast cancer in Great Britain, transfer of routine follow-up care to a family physician did not result in an increase in the time to diagnosis of recurrence (3). Patient satisfaction was greater and health service costs were less, and anxiety and health related quality of life were unaffected (4, 5). A similar multicenter trial of 968 early-stage breast cancer patients in Canada who had completed adjuvant treatment randomized patients to follow up in a cancer center or with their own family physician (6). This study found no statistically significant differences in number of recurrences, deaths, recurrence related serious clinical events, or patient reported health-related quality of life questionnaires between the groups. While transferring oncology follow-up care back to primary care physicians seems a reasonable alternative, the shortage of primary care physicians in certain regions of the US and around the world, limits this approach (7, 8). A study in Sweden compared nurse-led follow-up vs. physician follow-up in 264 consecutively selected women with newly diagnosed Stage I or II breast cancer (9). Outcomes included measures of patient well-being, satisfaction, access to medical care, and medical safety. Questionnaires containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Satisfaction and Accessibility (SaaC) scale were obtained at baseline and twice a year over a period of 5 years. Number of contacts with health care services, number of diagnostic procedures, and time to recurrence or death were monitored. Ratings of HADS and SaaC scales did not show any statistically significant differences between the follow-up groups. The levels of anxiety and depression were generally low, and levels of patient satisfaction high. There were no differences between the groups concerning time to recurrence or death suggesting that follow-up care with an experienced nurse professional is safe and effective.

Various strategies have been studied to evaluate alternatives to routine clinic visits and referrals to subspecialists in order to improve access to care and to lower health care costs. One such study tested the hypotheses that virtual outreach would reduce number of contacts with the health care system, reduce the number of medical tests and interventions, and have a positive impact on patient satisfaction. A randomized controlled trial was conducted which compared standard outpatient referral to joint teleconsultations between general practitioners (GP), specialists, and patients (10). Patients randomized to virtual outreach underwent a joint teleconsultation, in which they and their GP consulted with a hospital specialist via a videolink. In this study, patients in the virtual outreach group were more likely to be scheduled for a follow-up appointment, but fewer tests and investigations were ordered. In the 6-month period following the initial consultation, there were no significant differences in number of contacts or outpatient visits with GP, inpatient stays, procedures, or prescriptions between the randomized groups. Patient satisfaction was greater after a virtual outreach consultation, and patient enablement and the physical and psychological scores of the Short Form-12, did not differ between the randomized groups. Interestingly, health care costs over 6 months were greater for the virtual outreach consultations than for conventional outpatients, but overall cost, time, and productivity savings to patients were identified. This study represents an example of how technology can be utilized to streamline care and provide more patient centered services, but that these services may not save money overall in the health care system. The need to assess the cost-effectiveness and patient outcomes of alternate surveillance and follow up strategies was recently highlighted in a review article by Tolaney (11).

UCSF and Dynamic Clinical Systems (DCS) Collaboration The UCSF Breast Care Center has embarked upon collaboration with Dynamic Clinic Systems to implement a computer based, patient centered system of symptom reporting and data collection to improve clinical care to our patients and generate databases of patient reported symptoms and outcomes information for research purposes. Dynamic Clinical Systems (DCS) is a provider of real-time Web-based applications focusing on the patient-clinician interaction. The DCS approach enables patients to provide health data electronically. Clinicians may use this data for research, medical documentation, and registries depending on the type of data collected and the consent of the patient.

Through this system, patients will report their own health information via the DCS web-based Integrated Survey System (ISS). The process is as follows: A real-time interface downloads appointments from the hospital scheduling system into ISS. Survey groups are automatically scheduled based on pre-defined timing parameters. Prior to sending the patient their first survey, each patient will be called and welcomed to the program and asked if they use the internet. If they do, they will be given instructions for completion of surveys at home. If they need assistance, they will be given an appointment to come to our resource center and work with our staff member to complete the survey. The patient will be notified (via automatically-generated email from ISS or hospital letter/phone) to either sign on and take the survey from home or come to clinic early to take the survey. Once logged in, the patient has the opportunity to indicate online consent (to be approved by CHR) to share data for research purposes. An analyst will monitor the progress of survey completion and will call any patient whose surveys are not complete prior to their clinic appointment to facilitate survey completion. At the end of the process, a patient summary report is generated in ISS displaying a summary of patient survey answers, longitudinal comparisons of previous surveys, red flags and warnings, and quality measures. The clinician uses this report during the clinic visit to focus the discussion on highlighted items.

DCS is a service vendor who has built and who services the online-questionnaire platform. All content in the questionnaires has been created and reviewed by the investigators at UCSF (with the exception of standardized surveys such as the SF-36 and other validated questionnaires). Other than this, the DCS has no role in this study, and it does not receive or have access to information regarding study outcomes (such as in terms of patient visits or interventions) from either arm of the study.

We plan to implement and evaluate a comprehensive survivorship program, supported by this interactive web-based system for reporting physical and psychological symptoms. The system will capture structured data that then can be used to drive translation of research findings to improve care for survivors. The System for Individualized survivorship care, based on patient Self-reported data, with review by Nurse practitioners, targeted Education, and Triage to appropriate services to improve symptom management and outcomes will be called SIS.NET","Inclusion Criteria:

The 3 first cycles of treatment (first 9 weeks) constitute the main phase of the study during which most of the study objectives will be reached (safe dose clearance, tumor response rate characterization of DLT's, pharmacokinetic [PK] analysis of PLD). Patients will return to the study center on days 7 and 14 of cycles 1, 2 and 3, for monitoring assessments and for clinical laboratory evaluations. Blood samples will be collected on study visits for measurement of PLD concentrations at various time points during cycle 1. For each subject, subsequent dosing will take place 21 days after the previous treatment, provided patients are deemed fit to be dosed again.

For responding or stable patients, the extended phase of the study consists of 9 additional cycles (27 more weeks) during which further safety information, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) time, and other pertinent data will be collected. During both phases of the study and beyond, information on survival and post-study treatments will be collected until death. Information on potentially predictive biomarkers of treatment response (and duration of response) will be gathered all along the study.

All patients receiving two or more cycles will be followed-up for survival until death. Study treatment may continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal, patient loss to follow up, or termination of the study by the Sponsor or Investigator, whichever comes first. Pembrolizumab may be continued beyond disease progression. PLD will not be continued beyond disease progression.","Inclusion Criteria:

Primary

Determine differences between measures of cell proliferation (Ki-67) in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or stage I breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant fluvastatin sodium.

Secondary

Determine whether statin use differentially affects specific types of DCIS/early-stage breast cancer (comedo, estrogen receptor [ER]-positive, ER-negative).
Compare differences between tissue staining of CD68, circulating macrophages, and regulatory T cells in these patients.
Assess the feasibility of using inherent susceptibility (mRNA polymerase chain reaction testing) to predict response to statins in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (arms I or II). Patients accrued as control participants are assigned to arm III.

Arm I: Patients receive oral fluvastatin sodium once daily for 3-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Arm II: Patients receive oral fluvastatin sodium as in arm I at a higher dose.
Arm III (control): Patients do not receive fluvastatin sodium. All patients then undergo definitive surgery.

Patients in arms I and II undergo blood collection at baseline and at the time of surgery for biomarker analysis. Patients in arm III undergo blood collection at baseline and then approximately 1 month later. Tissue is collected from patients in all arms at the time of surgery. Blood and tissue samples are examined for biological markers, including Ki-67, C-reactive protein, cleaved caspase 3, HER2, CD68 gene, and estrogen and progesterone receptors by immunohistochemistry. Markers of inflammation (e.g., comedo necrosis macrophages and CD25-positive T cells), low-density lipoprotein, and cholesterol are also analyzed. Serum mRNA is measured by polymerase chain reaction.

This is a Phase II single-arm study of PBI with external-beam radiation therapy in which a group of select women with early-stage invasive and noninvasive breast cancer will be given radiation to the partial breast.,Radiation: multiple beams utilizing either intensity-modulated or 3D-conformal techniques,Radiation treatment,Experimental,"Currently the standard of care is to treat early stage invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with a combination of lumpectomy and radiotherapy, known as ""breast-conserving therapy"" (BCT). The traditional method of giving radiation therapy after a lumpectomy is to the whole breast.

However the investigators do not know if the whole breast needs to be receive radiation to better control your cancer or only a more limited area of the breast surrounding the tumor. The purpose of this study is to see the side effects of delivering partial breast irradiation (PBI) instead of whole breast irradiation (WBI). PBI is radiation therapy given only to the area of the breast where the cancer was removed. Another purpose of this study is to look long term at the rate at which cancer comes back in the same breast after PBI.

WBI is radiation therapy given 5 days a week for 5 to 7 weeks to the whole breast. Partial breast irradiation radiation therapy (PBI) is much shorter than whole breast irradiation. The investigators propose to deliver the PBI radiation therapy, for a few minutes a day, once a day, five days a week, for 2 weeks.

In this study the investigators will learn about the good and bad effects of PBI radiation therapy. In this study, the investigators will also learn about how the breast looks after surgery and radiation therapy.",Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) Using 40 Gy for Select Patients With Early Invasive or Noninvasive Breast Cancer,September 2024,Anticipated,Breast Cancer,D000009371,Neoplasms by Site,BC04,Neoplasms,Breast Cancer,M4910,Breast Neoplasms,high,D000001943,Breast Neoplasms,Single Group Assignment,None (Open Label),Treatment,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Unicentric Stage I (T1N0M0) invasive ductal breast cancer or Grade 1 or II DCIS measuring <2 cm on pathology and/or mammogram that is histologically confirmed at MSKCC
Histologically negative tumor margin 2 mm or more from any inked edges or no tumor in a re-excision specimen or final shaved specimen
ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1
Granulocytes ≥1,500/μl and platelet count must be ≥100,000/μl at the beginning of therapy for patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
Women >70 years or older with T1 invasive ductal carcinoma who are estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) with clinically negative axillary nodes and do not undergo surgical lymph node evaluation are eligible if patient will take hormonal therapy.
Patients with T1N0(i+) tumors on sentinel lymph node mapping or dissection (i.e., if tumor deposit is 0.2 mm or less, regardless of whether the deposit is detected by immunohistochemistry or hematoxylin and eosin staining) will also be eligible.
Clips must be placed in the lumpectomy cavity at the time of final excision in order to aid in the delineation of the tumor cavity at the time of simulation and radiation delivery.

Exclusion Criteria:

Patients with distant metastasis.
Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Patients with diffuse (>1 quadrant or >5 cm) suspicious microcalcifications.
Prior radiation therapy to the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or thorax.
Histological evidence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Cases termed focally suspicious for LVI but where no definitive LVI is found are eligible.
Histologic evidence of EIC, defined as the presence of intraductal carcinoma both within the primary infiltrating ductal tumor (comprising at least 25% of the tumor area) and intraductal carcinoma present clearly beyond the edges of the invasive tumor, or as a predominantly intraductal tumor with one or more areas of focal invasion.
Patients are not required to undergo BRCA1 and BRCA2 or other genetic mutation tests in order to enroll on the study. However, in the event a patient is tested and is found to be a mutation carrier, she would be excluded from the study. It would be an extremely rare/unlikely scenario for patients to be discovered BRCA positive after the completion of PBI, as all patients with risk factors for BRCA mutations (positive family history, Ashkenazi Jewish descent, ER-/PR-/her2-neu negative receptor status) are usually tested prior to radiation. Should such a situation exist, these patients will not receive additional RT and the patient will be replaced in the trial.
History of cosmetic or reconstructive breast surgery.
Psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from giving informed consent.
Patients for whom the delivery of PBI is not feasible
Medical condition such as uncontrolled infection (including HIV), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or connective tissue diseases (lupus, systemic sclerosis, or other collagen vascular diseases) that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

It not only results in a reduction in local and regional recurrence but also decrease the death rate effectively. For adjuvant radiotherapy, supine positioning is the most common approach and has multiple advantages. Due to deformability and softness of the breast, during simulation and treatment in supine position, the breast stretches over the chest wall, especially in patients with large and pendulous glands. Thus the organs at risk (OARs) received dose increased. The radiotherapeutic toxicity are unavoidable. Some present studies show that the prone positioning of patients can improve dose homogeneity and reduce the dose distribution in OARs in patients with large and pendulous glands. Chinese women have relatively small breasts, the advantages of those have not been established.
